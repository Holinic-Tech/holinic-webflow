That type of acute stress usually triggers shedding 2–3 months later, so the timing fits very closely.</p><p><strong>Main triggers:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Major emotional stress (May 2024, ongoing)</em> – can push hair follicles into shedding within 2–3 months.</li><li><em>Chronic stress (since Oct 2024, ongoing)</em> – continues to keep the hair cycle unsettled until the stress load eases.</li></ul><p><strong>Worst month:</strong> most likely around Jul–Aug 2024, about 10–12 weeks after the May stress event. You reported that shedding has already peaked and then stabilized, which fits this pattern.</p><p><strong>Stabilization:</strong> Because the acute May stress has passed its peak, stabilization began late summer 2024. However, the chronic stress that started in Oct 2024 is still active; that means the shedding won’t fully calm until that driver eases. When it does, stabilization typically follows within 4–8 weeks.</p><p><strong>Regrowth:</strong> You already noticed new baby hairs recently 🌱. That’s a strong sign your follicles are re‑engaging. Expect these to thicken steadily over the next several months.</p><p><em>Where you are now:</em> You’re in the early regrowth phase. The worst is behind you, and your scalp is already signaling recovery. With stress care and patience, fuller density will gradually return. ❤️</p>"}
