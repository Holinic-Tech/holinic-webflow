Because her stress load is still high, this schedule may stretch slightly, but her recent baby hairs are a good sign that recovery is underway. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Ongoing emotional and chronic stress, which align closely with her onset and continue to influence the cycle.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> Eva is in the stabilization phase — shedding may still fluctuate, but the worst has likely passed.
