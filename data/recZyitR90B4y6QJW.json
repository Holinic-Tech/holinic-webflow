Based on typical recovery timing, stabilization would be expected between Jun–Sep 2024, with early regrowth starting toward late 2024 or early 2025. Because the chronic and menopausal drivers remain active, full improvement may be slower, but each month of steadier stress and hormone balance helps. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Emotional stress, Jan 2024—its timing aligns most closely with when shedding intensified, layered on top of the ongoing hormonal baseline.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the stabilization phase—shedding has evened out, which means the follicles are settling.
