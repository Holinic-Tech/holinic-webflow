The main drivers are clear:</p><ul><li><em>Chronic illness flare</em> that began in Feb 2025 and is still ongoing — this keeps your hair in a stress cycle until the flare settles.</li><li><em>Medication change</em> from Mar–May 2025 — this likely layered on top of the flare with extra shedding, but is now winding down.</li><li><em>Major emotional stress</em> also noted, though without a date; these events usually echo in hair fall 2–3 months later.</li></ul><p><strong>Why these matter:</strong> Both illness flares and medication shifts disturb the growth cycle, sending more hairs into shedding 2–4 months later. Because your illness flare hasn’t resolved, the “waves” of shedding you describe fit perfectly.</p><p><strong>Timeline forecast ⏳</strong>:<br/>• Peak shedding: likely May–Jul 2025.<br/>• Medication-related shedding should have calmed by Sep–Nov 2025.<br/>• Ongoing flare means stabilization will only begin ~4–8 weeks after it eases.<br/>• Baby hairs (🌱) typically appear 6–8 weeks after stabilization.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re sitting in the <em>stabilization phase</em> — the medication fallout is easing, but the illness flare is still stretching things out. The absence of baby hairs is expected at this point; once the flare comes under control, regrowth will follow quickly.</p><p>❤️ You’re not alone in this. The body is very resilient — and when your system steadies, your hair will begin its rebound.</p>"}
