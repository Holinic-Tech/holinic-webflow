For this chronic pattern, stabilization tends to occur once stress levels ease or hormones are adjusted, with visible regrowth continuing slowly over months. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Ongoing chronic stress—its long duration and overlap with hormonal treatment make it the main sustaining factor, though improvements are already showing through new baby hairs. This ongoing driver may delay full stabilization slightly.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You appear to be in the <em>regrowth start</em> phase, as shedding has steadied and fine new hairs are visible. Keep supporting calm routines and balanced nutrition—these steady habits help new growth strengthen. 🌱</p>"}
