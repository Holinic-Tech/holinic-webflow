Based on the emotional stress recovery pattern, the worst shedding likely occurred around 2025‑08, with stabilization expected by about 2026‑02 and early regrowth following by spring 2026. Because the hormonal and adjustment stressors are still active, these dates may shift slightly later. <span>Dominant driver:</span> the ongoing hormonal treatment change (Jul 2025) best matches the continued shedding pattern and overlaps with the stressful relocation.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the stabilization phase—shedding should gradually lessen over the next few months, though regrowth may not be visible yet. Stay consistent with your routine; balance and patience are key. 🌱</p>"}
