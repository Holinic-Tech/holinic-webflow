Using rapid weight loss as the forecast basis, the most intense shedding likely falls around November–December 2025, with stabilization expected by April–June 2026 and early regrowth by mid‑2026 if improvements begin soon. Ongoing hormonal and stress factors may delay these dates slightly. <span>Dominant driver:</span> chronic stress and hormonal changes, as they are both persistent and align with the timing of visible hair loss.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the <em>peak</em> phase, when shedding appears heaviest. This stage is temporary—once stress, nutrition, and hormones stabilize, hair fall typically slows and new growth starts to appear a few months later. Stay patient and keep supporting your body’s recovery. 🌱</p>"}
