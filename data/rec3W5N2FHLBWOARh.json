However, because chronic stress and hormonal shifts remain active, shedding likely persists in waves. Based on the lag model, stabilization for any acute flare would typically occur within 3–12 months, followed by early regrowth a month or two later—but ongoing stress can delay that timeline slightly. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Chronic stress since 2013, which overlaps with other factors and remains active today, sustaining a fluctuating shedding pattern.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in a long stabilization phase, where loss fluctuates but the follicles are still capable of recovery once stress and hormonal balance improve.
