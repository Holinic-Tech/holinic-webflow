That lines up with two strong triggers: an <em>ongoing autoimmune/thyroid flare</em> starting Feb 2025 and a <em>medication change</em> in Mar 2025. You also mentioned a major emotional stress, which can amplify shedding waves.</p><p><strong>Why these matter:</strong> Autoimmune or thyroid flares can directly disrupt the hair cycle for as long as they’re active. Medication shifts often trigger shedding 1–4 months later, and emotional stress makes the fallout feel more up-and-down rather than steady.</p><p><strong>Timeline forecast ⏳</strong></p><ul><li><strong>Onset:</strong> May 2025 was when you first noticed more shedding.</li><li><strong>Worst phase:</strong> Expected around Jun–Jul 2025, with waves continuing into Aug.</li><li><strong>Stabilization:</strong> For the medication trigger, settling would usually come 3–9 months after the end date (so late 2025 into early 2026). But because your autoimmune flare is still ongoing, true stabilization can only begin once that’s under better control.</li><li><strong>Regrowth:</strong> New sprouts typically appear 4–8 weeks after stabilization—so once the flare calms, you could see baby hairs a couple of months later 🌱.</li></ul><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re still in the <em>stabilization waiting zone</em>: the medication trigger has passed, but the ongoing autoimmune driver is keeping shedding from fully calming. This explains the “comes in waves” feeling and why no baby hairs are visible yet.</p><p>❤️ The good news: once your body gets relief from the chronic flare, the shedding can settle quickly, and regrowth will follow. You’re not stuck here forever—you’re just in the middle stretch of the recovery arc. I’m not here to diagnose, but this map shows your hair <em>wants</em> to recover once the stressors ease.</p>"}
