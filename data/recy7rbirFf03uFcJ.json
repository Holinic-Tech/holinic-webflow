{"phase":"peak","anchors":{"worst_month":"2025-07","main_trigger":"Autoimmune flare (Feb 2025, ongoing)","onset_window":"2025-05 to 2025-06","regrowth_start":null,"stabilization_by":null,"stabilization_window":null},"timeline_html":"<p><strong>Here’s what I’m seeing:</strong> Your hair changes connect to three triggers: an autoimmune/thyroid flare that began in Feb 2025 and is still ongoing, a medication change starting in Mar 2025 (still active), and a major emotional stress episode. All of these can push hairs into shedding, but the ongoing illness flare is the main driver keeping things active.</p><p><strong>Why they matter:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Autoimmune/thyroid flare (since Feb 2025, ongoing):</em> Inflammation and hormonal shifts can directly disrupt the growth cycle, keeping shedding prolonged until the flare stabilizes.</li><li><em>Medication change (Mar–May 2025, ongoing):</em> Certain drugs can push follicles into rest, often peaking 2–4 months later.</li><li><em>Emotional stress (date not provided):</em> Intense stress can spark scalp shedding about 2–3 months after the event, though this tends to calm once emotions ease.</li></ul><p><strong>Timeline so far:</strong> You first noticed shedding 3–6 months before Sep 2025, which points to an onset around May–Jun 2025. Shedding likely reached its worst in Jun–Jul 2025. Because the autoimmune flare and medication are still active, stabilization has not fully begun yet. Shedding coming in waves matches overlapping triggers.</p><p><strong>What’s next:</strong> Once the flare and medication side settle, shedding should calm within about 3–6 months. Baby hairs usually appear ~6–8 weeks after stabilization 🌱. So if things improve this autumn, you’d expect visible regrowth toward early 2026.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re still in the <em>peak phase</em>, with shedding waves linked to ongoing triggers. That can feel discouraging, but once those drivers are dialed down, your shedding will ease, and regrowth will follow. ❤️</p><p><em>I’m not here to diagnose, but to show you the story your hair is telling: it’s still reacting to active stressors, not permanently lost.</em></p>"}
