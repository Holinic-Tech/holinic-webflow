Shedding should continue to calm through early 2025, with stabilization expected by midâ€‘2025 and visible regrowth becoming more consistent soon after. Because stress and perimenopausal changes are ongoing, recovery may be gradual. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Hormonal transition from stopping birth control in Decâ€¯2024, reinforced by chronic stress and early menopausal changes, best matches the timing and persistence of her hair changes.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> Pietra is in the stabilization phaseâ€”shedding is less erratic, and baby hairs show her follicles are reâ€‘engaging. Staying consistent with her recovery habits and stress care will help this progress continue toward fuller regrowth. ðŸŒ¿</p>"}
