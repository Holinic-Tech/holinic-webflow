Since then, it’s been coming in waves, which often happens when more than one trigger overlaps.</p><p><strong>Main triggers:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Chronic illness flare</em> since Feb 2025 and still ongoing. This keeps the system under pressure, so shedding won’t fully calm until the flare stabilizes.</li><li><em>Medication change</em> starting Mar 2025 and still active. These shifts can shock follicles into shedding after 2–4 months.</li><li><em>Major emotional stress</em> in the past 6 months (date not provided). Emotional stress alone can trigger shedding within 2–3 months, and combined with the other factors it likely amplified the waves you’ve felt.</li></ul><p><strong>Timing forecast:</strong> The biggest wave of shedding likely hit around Jun–Jul 2025, which matches your report that shedding is still fluctuating. Because your illness flare and medication change are ongoing, stabilization hasn’t fully begun yet. Once those triggers ease, shedding typically slows within 4–8 weeks.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re still in the <em>peak phase</em> of shedding, held up by ongoing drivers. That’s why no baby hairs are visible yet. When these triggers resolve, your follicles are ready to move into stabilization, and within another 1–2 months you should start to see those little regrowth sprouts 🌱.</p><p>❤️ You’re not alone in this. The shedding feels scary, but it reflects your body processing stressors—it’s not permanent. Each trigger has a clear horizon, and once your system steadies, regrowth is very possible.</p>"}
