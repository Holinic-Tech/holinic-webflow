Because your chronic condition is still active, this may delay stabilization, though the earlier fever episode helps us anchor a forecast. You can expect the worst shedding to cluster around August 2025, with gradual calming into early 2026 and regrowth becoming clearer by spring. <span>Dominant driver:</span> your ongoing chronic illness flare, since it continues past the one-time fever event and overlaps directly with when shedding began.</p>\n<p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You are in the stabilization phase: shedding is still higher than normal but should begin to plateau once your health flare settles. This can feel discouraging, but the fact you already saw some baby hairs is a positive sign that your follicles remain active. ðŸŒ±</p>"}
