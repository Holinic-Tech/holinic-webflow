Both are well‑known to push hairs into shedding mode after a delay.</p><p><ul><li><strong>Illness (Feb 2025):</strong> Hair shedding usually peaks about 2–3 months later, putting the worst period around Apr–May.</li><li><strong>Emotional stress (Apr–Jun 2025):</strong> This adds another wave, also peaking ~Jun–Jul.</li></ul></p><p><strong>Reported onset:</strong> You noticed shedding 1–3 months ago, which fits perfectly with this lag pattern. Right now you’re still in the heavy phase — your answers say “still worsening,” which matches being inside the peak window.</p><p><strong>Forecast:</strong> Shedding is likely to settle gradually once the impacts of both triggers fade. For the illness, stabilization is expected around Aug–Nov 2025. With the stress resolved by late Jun, its effects should calm by Sep–Dec 2025. Together, this suggests stabilization heading into autumn, with early regrowth 🌱 often visible a month or two later — around Nov–Dec if all continues smoothly.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re in the <em>peak shedding phase</em>. It’s tough, but it also means you’re at or near the worst point, and from here the direction is improvement. With your good sleep and nutrition habits, your hair has strong foundations for recovery. ❤️</p><p>I’m not here to diagnose, but to help you understand the timing your body is working on. The next stage is stabilization, and your first baby hairs should follow soon after.</p>"}
