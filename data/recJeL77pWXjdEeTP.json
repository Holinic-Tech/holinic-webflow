Based on the long-term pattern, the worst shedding waves likely occurred through 2024, with calmer periods emerging by mid‑2025 as hormones and stress management stabilize. Baby hairs seen months ago show that some regrowth has already begun. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Chronic stress, as it continues to act daily and overlaps with the hormonal transition, likely prolongs the shedding phase though improvement can follow once stress load lightens.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the stabilization phase—some balance is returning, and early regrowth has started 🌱. Continue consistent routines; even small reductions in stress can help more follicles stay in growth mode.</p>"}
