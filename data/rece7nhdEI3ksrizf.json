You’re in the <em>stabilization phase</em>—not getting worse, but not yet at regrowth either.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead ⏳:</strong> Once your flare eases, shedding should calm within 1–2 months. New baby hairs usually appear about 6–8 weeks later 🌱. This points toward visible regrowth signs in late 2025 or early 2026.</p><p>It may feel slow, but your follicles are strong and waiting for the all‑clear to regrow. You’re not alone in this, and every step you take now helps set up that recovery. ❤️</p>"}
