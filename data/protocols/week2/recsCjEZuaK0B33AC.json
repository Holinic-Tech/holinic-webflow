With your cycle absent and stress running high, supporting your hormones is the single “domino” that steadies your shed rate.

Because your main trigger — chronic stress that began last September — is still ongoing, your body hasn’t yet had the full chance to ease out of this storm. That’s why the focus this week is on stabilizing your system: signaling safety to your body so it can begin slowing the shed cycle.</p>\n  <p>With only 5–6 hours of broken sleep and 2–3 night wakings, your stress hormones remain high through the night. This keeps hair follicles “on alert” instead of allowing them to reset. The practices this week — anchoring your sleep, layering in gentle wind-downs, and optimizing your bedroom — target the biggest domino right now: calming cortisol and restoring nightly recovery. When your body feels rhythm and rest again, follicles can shift out of emergency mode and prepare for regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> steady sleep lowers stress signals that drive excess shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm:</strong> consistent nights help balance cycles disrupted by past hormonal changes</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deeper rest gives follicles the energy to hold onto hairs longer</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Resilience building:</strong> better sleep creates a buffer against daily stress triggers</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your sleep, you’re telling your body it’s safe to slow the shed and prepare for those baby hairs to grow stronger 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
