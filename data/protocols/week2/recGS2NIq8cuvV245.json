At this stabilization phase, your follicles need calm consistency to fully reset. This practice is your “big domino” — lowering stress signals that still nudge shedding and letting your body prioritize regrowth again.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a daily cue:</strong> Choose one anchor time (right after your workout cooldown or before bed) to practice — only 5–8 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Breathe in cycles:</strong> Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 counts, hold 2 counts, exhale through your mouth for 6. Repeat for 12 breaths.</li>\n<li><strong>Ground your body:</strong> As you exhale, let shoulders drop and notice tension leaving your scalp, forehead, and jaw.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional deep reset:</strong> Once or twice a week, play a short yoga nidra or body-scan recording before bed to extend the effect.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling warmer hands/feet within minutes (circulation returning), fewer post‑workout energy crashes, and calmer evenings within 10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping rest days after intense workouts — it keeps cortisol high. Fix: swap one training session for a slow walk + this breathing set.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you recognize the small habits that quietly drain your recovery energy and replace them with ones that actually feed your calm, your hormones, and your scalp health.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Sommer, you’re in the stabilization phase—your regrowth has started to peek through, but chronic stress and restrictive routines still pull against it. This shift is your “big domino”: by catching stress‑driven over‑exercise or skipped meals before they spiral, you free up nutrients and lower cortisol, the two conditions your follicles crave to move solidly into regrowth. Every calm decision now locks in the progress your scalp has been working toward all year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Notice your trigger moments.</strong> When stress spikes, pause to ask, “What am I about to do that might deplete me further?” (e.g., push another workout, skip dinner, stay up late planning.)</li>\n<li><strong>Swap depletion for restoration.</strong> Choose one nourishing counter-habit—slow 10‑minute walk, stretch, glass of water, or journaling your next meal plan—instead of pushing harder.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a visible cue.</strong> Jot your top 3 “restore swaps” on a sticky note near your workout gear or laptop as a mid‑day reminder.</li>\n<li><strong>End each evening with reflection.</strong> Note one moment you chose recovery over rushing. That recognition wires the new habit in place.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling fewer energy crashes mid‑day, improved appetite signals returning, and calmer evenings after stressful days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> You may still over‑train on high‑stress weeks—set a two‑rest‑day minimum and treat them as non‑negotiable recovery time.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each small, self‑protective choice keeps your body out of fight‑or‑flight and your scalp in growth mode. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance your body’s key messengers — estrogen, cortisol, and thyroid regulators — through rhythm, rest, and nourishment, so your scalp can hold onto new growth instead of staying in “alarm mode.”</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Sommer, you’re in the stabilization phase — meaning your shedding is calming but still tugged by perimenopause and stress. Because your hormones, nutrition, and metabolism are all talking to each other, this practice is your big domino. Strengthening hormonal balance now helps each new hair root anchor more securely and keeps your regrowth wave from slipping backward as stress or sleep pressure rise.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor your meals:</strong> Eat three balanced meals at consistent times; include at least one protein‑rich serving (~30 g) at breakfast to steady cortisol and blood sugar.</li>\n  <li><strong>Light–movement pairing:</strong> Swap one intense workout for a slower recovery session (walk, stretch, or gentle yoga) 3x per week to lower hormonal stress signals.</li>\n  <li><strong>Evening wind‑down cue:</strong> Dim lights, slow breathing, and no screens 30 min before bed to boost melatonin and reduce nighttime cortisol spikes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Replenish iron‑rich foods:</strong> Include lentils, red meat, or spinach with vitamin C daily to counter low‑iron history and fuel follicle oxygenation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track warmth + mood:</strong> Note any changes in sleep, temperature sensitivity, or energy over two weeks; small steadiness here signals hormonal recalibration.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable afternoon energy, fewer “rush” feelings after workouts, and slightly glossier new hairs near the hairline within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or pushing workouts too hard spikes stress hormones — quick fix: swap to a protein‑first meal and lighter exercise day.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Steady the Ground Beneath Your Hair 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Sommer, you’re in the stabilization phase — the toughest stretch, but also the turning point. Your shedding has eased since the worst months after your illness, yet ongoing stress, perimenopause, and strict dieting still keep your body on alert. This week’s focus on steadiness helps your system finally believe it’s safe to shift resources back to growth.</p>\n  <p>When stress and hormones fluctuate, cortisol and estrogen tug at the same control panel that regulates your follicles. By anchoring your sleep and calming your evenings, you lower nightly cortisol and allow growth hormones to do their quiet repair work. With your 6–7 hours of sleep, occasional night work, and high stress, creating a consistent wind‑down and bedroom routine is the “big domino” that steadies everything—from hormones to scalp circulation.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calms cortisol surges:</strong> helps stop stress from pushing follicles into shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormonal balance:</strong> steadier nights mean smoother estrogen and thyroid rhythms</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Improves deep‑sleep repair:</strong> fuels follicle recovery and strengthens baby hairs</li>\n    <li>🌿 <strong>Rebuilds resilience:</strong> prepares you for the regrowth phase predicted to strengthen through early 2025</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm, consistent night you create tells your body: “the storm has passed.” That’s when shedding truly settles and new strands begin to hold. 🌱</em></p>\n</div>"}}
