Sleep regularity and amino acids/iron help progesterone stay steadier, lowering hair fall pressure.</li> \n<li>By buffering stress load now, you shorten the “lag” so stabilization can begin this fall, and regrowth has space to take hold. ✨</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Increasing fatigue, very heavy bleeding, or dizziness → ask your doctor about iron/ferritin check.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 2 weeks you notice waking feels easier, PMS slightly smoother, or shedding volume stops increasing.</li> \n<li>Be gentle—your body is still catching up from illness and over‑exercising.
