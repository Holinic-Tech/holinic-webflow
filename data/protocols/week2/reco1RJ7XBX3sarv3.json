This practice is your big domino because calming daily stress signals tells your follicles the danger has passed. As your nervous system steadies, shedding eases and you move closer to the regrowth window coming in early spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your cue:</strong> Right after finishing work or before bed, cue yourself with a calm sound—music, chime, or silence.</li>\n<li><strong>Ground your breath:</strong> Sit with feet flat, inhale slowly for 4 counts, pause 1 beat, exhale 6 counts. Repeat 10 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Add body release:</strong> As you exhale, let shoulders and jaw soften; imagine the day’s weight leaving your scalp area.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional deep reset:</strong> Once or twice a week, try a 10‑minute yoga nidra or guided meditation audio lying down before sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Record your calm:</strong> Note tension level (1‑10) before and after. Over time, watch that number drop faster.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You feel looser behind the eyes and jaw within minutes; sleep comes easier; morning shedding slows slightly after two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating right after stress spikes can undo the calm—take three slow breaths before grabbing food, and decide if you’re truly hungry.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one centered breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you swap emotional eating or tension‑driven habits for true stress releases that calm your system and protect your growth cycle. It isn’t about restriction—it’s about redirecting your energy toward actions that give your body steadiness again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re in the stabilization phase—shedding should start easing as your body finds its footing after the hectic move and hormonal changes. Emotional eating once helped you cope, but now it quietly keeps stress chemistry active. Mastering this one shift is your “big domino”: it steadies your cortisol so your follicles can stay grounded long enough to re‑enter growth by spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Spot the moment:</strong> When you feel the familiar pull to snack from stress, pause for just five breaths. Name what’s really happening (“I’m tense after that call”).</li>\n<li><strong>Redirect, don’t resist:</strong> Choose a replacement that releases pressure—short walk, gentle stretching, or jotting one sentence in your phone note about what you need right now.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor calm with nourishment:</strong> Plan your next real meal with a mix of protein, fiber, and color. Having satisfying food options ready lowers the chance of impulse eating.</li>\n<li><strong>End each day with a reset ritual:</strong> Before bed, make tea, dim lights, and note one stress win you handled differently. It trains your brain to see calm as success.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You notice fewer stress snacks by week two, calmer digestion, and evenings feel lighter instead of foggy or guilty.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Mindless late‑night scrolling often reignites cravings—try plugging your phone to charge in another room 30 minutes before bed.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each time you catch the urge and choose stillness, you’re rewriting your stress loop and protecting every strand. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance your body’s key messengers—especially after changes in birth control or major stress—so hair cycles can calm and re‑sync naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, your ongoing hormonal shift that began in July and the stress of adjusting to a new country can both nudge shedding to linger. You’re in stabilization now—the moment when small daily choices make the biggest difference. Supporting hormonal balance gives your follicles the steady environment they need so shedding eases and new growth can take root by early spring. This is your pivot point toward lasting calm and strength in your hair. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start your day with protein:</strong> within 60 min of waking, include roughly 25–30 g of protein (e.g., eggs, Greek yogurt, or tofu) to anchor blood‑sugar and hormone rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your meal pattern steady:</strong> aim for three balanced meals, spread 4–5 hours apart, focusing on whole foods and healthy fats like avocado or salmon twice a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Support your cycle naturally:</strong> track day‑1 of each period and note energy, mood, and cravings—this connects you to subtle hormonal cues instead of fighting them.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind down electronics and snacks:</strong> stop high‑sugar or heavy snacks within two hours of bed to lower nighttime cortisol and support deeper repair.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your iron and vitamin D:</strong> if not recently tested, schedule labs with your provider; deficiencies often mimic hormonal imbalance in the scalp.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier energy through the afternoon, fewer sugar cravings before bed, and a gradual decline in daily shedding after a few weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> emotional eating during high‑stress days can spike blood sugar and hormones—pause for 5 slow breaths, sip water, or step outside before choosing comfort food.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each balanced plate is a quiet message to your body that safety has returned. Keep going, Marilou. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Help Your Body Feel Safe Again 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Marilou, you’re entering your stabilization phase — that gentle turning point when shedding should start easing after the long wave driven by your hormonal treatment change and the stress of relocating. Right now, your system’s message is simple: “keep things steady.” This week’s practices focus on restoring rhythm and calm so your body can shift out of its stress-protection mode.</p>\n  <p>When we sleep deeply and at consistent times, cortisol levels settle, the nervous system quiets, and growth hormones rise — the same signals your follicles read as safety. With your 6–7 hours of sleep and a bedtime that moves by about an hour, locking in a steady sleep anchor and calm wind-down is the fastest way to convince your body that the danger has passed. That’s what opens the door for regrowth later this spring.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress hormones:</strong> calm cortisol so shedding phases shorten</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal stability:</strong> supports balance after the contraceptive change</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper rest:</strong> triggers nighttime growth signals and tissue repair</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Reset safety cues:</strong> helps the scalp shift from “protect” to “regrow”</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your wind‑down and bedtime, you’re teaching your body that stability is the new normal — and calmer shedding is just the start 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
