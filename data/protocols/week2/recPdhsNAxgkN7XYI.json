Feel the exhale soften your shoulders.</li>\n<li><strong>Add body release:</strong> On each exhale, let one muscle group melt—jaw, neck, chest, abdomen, thighs—until your whole body feels heavier.</li>\n<li><strong>End with intention:</strong> Whisper to yourself, “My body is safe to rest and repair.” Stay still for one more slow breath before moving on.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional upgrade:</strong> Use a short guided yoga nidra or nature‑sound clip if sound helps you switch off faster.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You notice your pulse slowing quicker after tension, your scalp tingling less during stress spikes, and your sleep feeling deeper within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping the practice after late‑night scrolling keeps your nervous system keyed up.

It’s about bringing your body back into rhythm from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Aidee, right now you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has softened, and those baby hairs hint your follicles are ready to rebuild. But chronic stress and irregular periods can still jolt your hormones, keeping roots on edge. This is your “big domino”: balancing your hormonal rhythm now helps convert fragile regrowth into stronger, anchored strands as you move toward full recovery this spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a regular meal rhythm:</strong> Eat within an hour of waking and every 4–5 hours. Regular fueling steadies blood sugar and supports hormone balance.</li>\n  <li><strong>Boost iron and protein:</strong> Include an iron-rich food (like lentils, red meat, or spinach) and 20–30 g of protein at two meals daily to feed active follicles.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build one “calm reset” break:</strong> Take a 10‑minute pause mid‑day—no phone, no scrolling—slow breathing or stretching helps reset cortisol patterns that stress your cycles.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anchor sleep hours:</strong> Even with shift work, carve a consistent wind‑down time. Hormonal repair peaks when you get 6+ hours in an unbroken block.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track your cycles gently:</strong> Note when periods arrive or skip; over two‑three months you’ll see signals of steadier hormonal flow.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More predictable energy by week 2, easier mornings, and fewer oily or tender scalp days as cortisol dips normalize.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals during high-pressure days can spike stress hormones and worsen shedding—keep a small protein snack handy.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced day at a time, your body learns safety again and your roots follow. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about training your body to treat sleep like a skill — one that restores hormones, calms the stress system, and strengthens the growth signals your hair depends on.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Aidee, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding still comes in waves, but baby hairs are sprouting. Because chronic stress is still active and you sleep only 5–6 hours due to shift work, this step is your “big domino.” Sharpening your sleep quality tells your nervous system it’s safe again, helping your scalp hold on to new growth as you move toward your regrowth season next spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Protect your last full hour before bed.</strong> Block it on your schedule as “non‑negotiable.” Dim lights, end tasks, and let your body drop in energy — you’re signaling safety.</li>\n  <li><strong>Honor your wake time.</strong> Even if bedtime shifts, keep the same wake‑up window daily (within 30 min). It trains your internal clock to stabilize hormones that control shedding.</li>\n  <li><strong>Step into natural morning light.</strong> Within 15 minutes of waking, get light in your eyes — balcony, window, or brief outdoor exposure all count.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use a 10‑minute midday reset.</strong> Sit quietly, breathe, or step outside. This lowers cortisol peaks that interfere with deep sleep later.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mark your cutoff.</strong> No stressful conversations, scrolling, or intense work 60 minutes before bed. Protect that zone like your hair depends on it — because right now, it does. 💫</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking with steadier energy, easier falling back asleep after night wakings, and less scalp tingling or sensitivity within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Shift‑work catch‑up days often tempt “doom scrolling.” Instead, keep lights low and play calm audio or journal for 5 minutes to signal shutdown.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one rested night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your Body So Shedding Can Finally Settle 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Aidee, you’re now in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong>—the part where shedding waves start to quiet and your scalp learns that the danger has passed. Because your <strong>chronic stress is still ongoing</strong>, this first week focuses on resetting your inner rhythm through sleep and calm. It’s the signal to your body that it’s safe to stay out of “fight‑or‑flight” and return to steady growth.</p>\n  <p>Your survey showed 5–6 hours of rest and shift‑style sleep patterns. That irregular rhythm keeps cortisol active and delays the body’s nightly repair cycle. The practices this week—anchoring your bedtime, winding down without screens, and optimizing your sleep space—work together to lower stress hormones, steady blood sugar, and restore growth signals that hair follicles depend on. This is the “big domino” that makes every other strategy work faster.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> lowers the stress signal that keeps follicles in the shed phase</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper restorative sleep:</strong> boosts growth hormone release and scalp repair overnight</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone balance:</strong> steadies cycles affected by chronic stress and irregular periods</li>\n    <li>💆 <strong>Nervous‑system calm:</strong> trains your body to stay relaxed even when daily stress hits</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your rest, you’re teaching your system safety again—one peaceful sleep at a time toward calmer shedding and visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
