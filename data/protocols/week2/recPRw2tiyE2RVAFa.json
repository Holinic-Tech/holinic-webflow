This practice is your “big domino”: calming your stress chemistry each day so those new hairs can anchor and thicken as you move fully into regrowth by spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set aside 5 minutes morning or night.</strong> Sit upright, feet grounded, one hand on your belly and one on your chest.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice the 4‑7‑8 breath:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale slowly through your mouth for 8. Repeat 4 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a micro‑reset mid‑day.</strong> When tension builds, exhale fully, drop your shoulders, and notice one sound around you until your body softens.</li>\n<li><strong>Before bed,</strong> lie down, scan your body from toes to crown, relaxing each area. Let your mind rest on your breath instead of the day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling calmer after stressful emails or calls, falling asleep faster, and noticing steadier energy within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you skip breathing on “busy” days, tension rewinds progress; anchor it to an existing cue (like brushing teeth) for consistency.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one peaceful breath at a time, Mimi. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you rebalance internal rhythms that quietly drive shedding and regrowth. It brings daily actions—food, rest, and calm—into harmony so your hormones can support thicker, steadier hair again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, you’re in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong>: shedding is calming, and those baby hairs show your scalp is responding. Chronic stress and a past thyroid or hormone imbalance still tug at your system, so strengthening hormonal balance now is your “big domino.” This work steadies your internal chemistry as you move toward the regrowth window this spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your meals:</strong> Eat three balanced meals daily, each with 20–30 g protein. Your morning meal is most crucial—try eggs, Greek yogurt, or tofu with fiber‑rich carbs.</li>\n<li><strong>Support mineral reserves:</strong> Include iron‑rich foods (lentils, red meat, spinach) plus vitamin C sources to aid absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance blood sugar:</strong> Pair every snack with protein or healthy fat (nuts, hummus, boiled egg) to prevent cortisol spikes.</li>\n<li><strong>Slow evening rhythm:</strong> Dim lights an hour before bed and swap scrolling for gentle stretching or slow breathing—your adrenals exhale here.</li>\n<li><strong>Cycle‑care journal:</strong> Track mood, energy, and flow each month; noticing patterns helps identify which habits soothe your hormones the most.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy through the day, fewer sugar or caffeine cravings, and calmer pre‑period moods within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast—especially if stress feels high—can send cortisol surging; fix by keeping a grab‑and‑go protein option handy.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds hormonal harmony—each balanced meal and calm night is a vote for thicker, steadier growth ahead. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you use science‑backed tweaks—the same kind sleep experts rely on—to let your brain and body slip smoothly into deep, healing rest each night.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, you’re in your stabilization phase: shedding is calming and new baby hairs are just beginning to push through. Because chronic stress and thyroid changes are still active, restoring robust, rhythmic sleep is your big domino. Each night of deep rest steadies stress signals that once told your follicles to pause. Protect your sleep now, and you shorten the path toward thicker, steadier growth by spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor morning light:</strong> Get direct daylight on your eyes within 30 minutes of waking—through a window or outside. It locks in your sleep‑wake rhythm naturally.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep a fixed rise time:</strong> Choose a wake‑up time you can hold steady seven days a week (even weekends). Your brain builds sleep pressure more predictably this way.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cool your sleep zone:</strong> Aim for a slightly cooler room (18–20 °C / 65–68 °F). A small temperature drop signals your body it’s time to rest deeply.</li>\n  <li><strong>Dim tech lighting after sunset:</strong> Reduce overhead and screen brightness, or use warm filters—this helps melatonin rise on time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Nourish recovery:</strong> Because you eat lightly, include a small protein or magnesium‑rich snack if you feel wired at night—it steadies blood sugar and calms stress hormones.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking easier without alarms, feeling less “wired‑but‑tired,” and noticing steadier energy mid‑afternoon.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping morning light exposure after stressful nights can delay your sleep cycle—step outside for even two minutes to reset.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each rested morning signals safety to your system and strength to your hair roots. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Bring Your Body Back to Calm for Stronger Regrowth 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Mimi, you’re now in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — that sweet spot where shedding begins to settle and those new baby hairs can take hold. Because your <strong>chronic stress (since Jul 2024)</strong> is still active, this week is all about helping your body feel safe again. When your system no longer senses ongoing threat, it stops prioritizing survival and starts rebuilding — including your hair.</p>\n  <p>These practices—anchoring sleep, winding down your evenings, and optimizing your bedroom—work at the root level of recovery. Deep, consistent rest lowers cortisol, steadies thyroid and sex hormones, and boosts growth signals that tell follicles it’s time to shift from shedding to strengthening. With your regular 7–8 hours of sleep and minimal night wakings, even small tweaks in rhythm and recovery can make a big difference now.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Reset stress chemistry:</strong> calm cortisol spikes that keep follicles in “alert” mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Stabilize hormones:</strong> support thyroid and reproductive balance after prolonged stress</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Boost follicle energy:</strong> improve nutrient delivery and oxygen to growing hairs</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deepen nightly repair:</strong> enhance growth‑phase hormones released during uninterrupted sleep</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm, consistent night you create helps your body trust the storm is over—and that’s when stronger, steadier regrowth begins 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
