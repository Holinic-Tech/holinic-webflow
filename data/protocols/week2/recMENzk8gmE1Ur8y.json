{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Mental Resilience Training helps you calm an overactive stress system using simple breathwork and micro‑meditation cues, so your body shifts from “fight or flight” into repair mode — the same mode your follicles need to rest and regrow.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase — your shedding has slowed but your follicles are still tense from years of chronic stress, hormonal flux, and limited sleep. This practice is your big domino because it teaches your brain to release daily tension before it reaches the scalp. Each calm breath helps tilt your body back toward the steady hormone rhythms that invite regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor one pause:</strong> right after brushing your teeth, sit or lie down, close your eyes, and set a 4‑minute timer.</li>\n  <li><strong>Breathe 4‑7‑8:</strong> inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, and exhale slowly through the mouth for 8. Repeat for five rounds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add one word:</strong> on each exhale, silently say “release.” Let your shoulders drop and jaw unclench.</li>\n  <li><strong>End with a body check:</strong> notice your heartbeat slowing and the gentle buzz leaving your chest — that’s your nervous system resetting.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional boost:</strong> play soft instrumental music or do this lying flat to mimic yoga nidra for deeper calm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> falling asleep a little faster, fewer nighttime wake‑ups, and a quiet clarity on waking within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> doom‑scrolling or late caffeine after 3 pm keeps your stress loop open — try placing your phone on charge in another room after your breathing session.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady breath at a time, Pietra. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance key female hormones that shape your hair’s growth rhythm. It works by aligning simple daily habits—like nourishment, rest, and rhythm—so your follicles receive steadier hormonal signals for repair and regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding has slowed from its worst point, but hormonal shifts from ending treatment and entering menopause still keep follicles on edge. Because long-term stress also tugs at these same pathways, this practice becomes your “big domino.” Focusing on steadier hormonal balance now helps move you from fragile stabilization toward visible regrowth and stronger, calmer cycles ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your meals:</strong> Eat within an hour of waking and every 4–5 hours, including a palm-sized protein at each meal to support steady blood sugar and hormone signals.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize iron and omega‑3s:</strong> Add one iron-rich food daily (like lentils, red meat, or spinach + vitamin C pairing) and 2–3 servings of fatty fish weekly or a plant-based alternative.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your sleep hormones:</strong> Set a steady bedtime and cut caffeine after noon; give yourself a 60‑minute digital wind-down to lower cortisol before bed.</li>\n<li><strong>Nourish your stress axis:</strong> Take 5 deep belly breaths every hour or use a 5‑minute stretch break whenever you catch yourself doom‑scrolling.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your body signals:</strong> Note any change in skin, mood, or energy as subtle signs your hormones are re‑synchronizing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More consistent energy through the day, steadier mood on waking, and slightly less heaviness at the scalp within 2–3 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late caffeine or screens before bed can blunt your progress—set a “no‑scroll” alarm 60 minutes before sleep as a quick fix.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds calm and balance—every day you regulate your rhythm, you’re reminding your follicles that safety has returned. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<h3>What it is</h3> \n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you train your body to sleep more deeply by building small cues around light, temperature, and morning rhythm — so rest starts to repair you on autopilot.</p> \n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3> \n<p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase, where calmer sleep can finally slow the ongoing shedding from long‑term stress and hormonal shifts. Because chronic stress and night‑shift rhythms still tug at your recovery, this practice is your “big domino.” Deep, regular rest steadies your hormones and prepares follicles to move into regrowth in the months ahead.</p> \n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3> \n<ol> \n<li><strong>Claim your light cue:</strong> On waking, step outside or at a bright window within 10 minutes for at least 5 minutes. Natural light anchors your brain clock more than any supplement can.</li> \n<li><strong>Cool down your sleep cave:</strong> Aim for a bedroom temperature near 65–67 °F. If your space runs warm, use a fan or lighter bedding — even a 2 °F drop deepens sleep stages.</li> \n<li><strong>Schedule a “body signal”: </strong> Keep one pre‑bed ritual (like washing your face or stretching) at roughly the same time nightly so your mind links it with shutdown.</li> \n<li><strong>Trim artificial brightness:</strong> Dim screens and overhead lights 90 minutes before bed; use only warm lamps after that window so melatonin rises smoothly.</li> \n<li><strong>Morning movement:</strong> Add 2–5 minutes of gentle mobility after waking to cue your body it’s daytime — even neck rolls at the sink count.</li> \n</ol> \n<h3>What to look for</h3> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep within 15–20 minutes, waking up fewer than 2 times per night, and feeling subtly calmer before your first coffee.</li> \n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night doom‑scrolling keeps cortisol high and fragments sleep. Quick fix: leave the phone charging in another room and swap it for calming audio or journaling by hand.</li> \n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one rested morning at a time. 🌱</li> \n</ul> \n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Steady the Ground Beneath Your Roots 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase — the storm of shedding has already passed its worst, but your system is still under pressure from ongoing chronic stress and hormonal shifts. This week is about creating safety signals in your body so it can finally stop defending and start repairing. With your history of night wakings, short sleep, and late caffeine, calming your nervous system at night is the most powerful lever you can pull right now.</p>\n  <p>When you anchor your sleep and lower evening stimulation, cortisol levels settle and your hormonal rhythm begins to normalize. That shift helps follicles move out of the “protective pause” they’ve been in for years. Deep, predictable rest also boosts growth hormone — the quiet repair messenger that tells your scalp it’s safe to regrow. Each of this week’s practices — steady bedtime, gentle wind‑down, and a caffeine fence — restores that internal rhythm.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> lowers chronic stress signals that prolong shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormone recalibration:</strong> steadier sleep helps balance estrogen and thyroid patterns</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Improves sleep depth:</strong> more deep sleep means stronger nightly repair and collagen renewal</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Prepares follicles for regrowth:</strong> consistent rest cues your scalp that stability has returned</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm evening you protect your sleep, you’re teaching your body that the crisis is over — and opening the door for thicker, steadier hair ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
