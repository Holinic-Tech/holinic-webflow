Do 6–8 rounds while noticing your shoulders drop.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a short body scan.</strong> Quietly move your attention from head to toes, releasing tiny areas of tension. If your mind wanders, guide it gently back.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional upgrade:</strong> Once or twice a week, play a 10‑minute yoga‑nidra or guided relaxation track lying down — it’s like a nap for your nervous system.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice a slower heartbeat, lighter chest, or easier evenings within a week. Sleep feels deeper and morning shedding may look a bit calmer by the second week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late‑day caffeine quietly keeps stress hormones high. Try switching to herbal tea after 3 p.m. to lock in your calm evenings.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady breath, one quiet evening at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you recognize those “auto‑pilot” habits that spike stress and quietly drain your body’s hair‑building energy—then swap them for simple calming actions that leave you steadier and more in control.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rochelle, you’re in stabilization—the phase where your scalp is ready to strengthen those baby hairs, but chronic stress is still holding the brakes. Because emotional eating has been your go‑to coping tool, this step is your big domino: replacing that cycle gently resets stress chemistry so your follicles can stay nourished and out of the shedding zone.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Spot the trigger.</strong> Write down one moment a day when you feel the urge to stress‑snack or emotionally eat. Just note what you felt—no judgment.</li>\n<li><strong>Pause and pivot.</strong> Before reaching for food, take three slow breaths, then step away from the kitchen for one minute. This short gap rewires the habit loop.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap in a “micro‑soother.”</strong> Choose one: a quick outside walk, gentle shoulder stretch, or jotting a gratitude line in your notes app. You’re teaching your body new relief routes.</li>\n<li><strong>Reward the swap.</strong> End each successful swap by saying out loud, “I kept my calm.” This celebrates progress—small wins tell your mind the new pattern is worth keeping.</li>\n<li><strong>Track one change a week.</strong> Aim for fewer snack‑for‑stress episodes by week’s end. Progress, not perfection, is the goal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling more “even” between meals, fewer evening cravings, and a calmer mind during daily stress peaks within 10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late‑day caffeine can spike stress and trigger cravings—try moving your last cup before 2 pm to help the swaps stick.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one calm choice rewiring your stress axis at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you steady the internal rhythm that influences your hair cycle, mood, and energy. By supporting balance through simple daily habits, you allow your follicles to receive clearer, more consistent growth signals.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rochelle, you’re in the stabilization phase—your scalp is ready to rebuild, but stress and fluctuating hormones still tug on that progress. Because your cycles are regular yet heavy with PMS and spotty days, calming these hormonal swings is your big domino. Each balanced week moves you closer from “still worsening” toward visible thickening by mid‑2025, when regrowth naturally accelerates.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start your day with protein:</strong> Aim for about 30 g within an hour of waking (eggs, yogurt, or tofu). This steadies blood sugar and keeps your stress hormones low.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a mineral anchor:</strong> Include iron‑rich foods daily—lentils, beef, spinach—with vitamin C‑rich foods nearby to aid absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening calm ritual:</strong> 20 min of slow breathing, light stretching, or journaling before bed to lower cortisol surges that disturb your hormonal rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your cycle gently:</strong> Note days of cramps, mood changes, or shedding spikes in a notebook. Patterns will guide when you need extra nourishment or rest.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable mood across your cycle, less afternoon energy crash, and scalp feels less oily or tender within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-afternoon caffeine (after 3 pm) can spike cortisol again—swap for herbal tea or warm lemon water instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, one calm morning meal and centered evening at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑teaching Your Body That It’s Safe to Stop Shedding 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Rochelle, you’re now in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong>—a turning point where your scalp begins to calm after months of chronic stress kept the “danger” signal switched on.
