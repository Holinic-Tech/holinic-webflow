{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Mental Resilience Training helps you calm your overactive stress system through gentle breathing, guided relaxation, or slow yoga — simple practices that restore balance and help your body feel safe enough to grow again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, you’re in your stabilization phase — your baby hairs show progress, but ongoing emotional and chronic stress still ripple through your system. This practice is your “big domino” because steadying your nervous system now prevents renewed shedding and turns stress chemistry into growth chemistry. Mastering calm is what moves you from fragile stabilization toward true regrowth through 2025 and beyond.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create your 5‑minute space:</strong> Sit or lie down, eyes closed, away from screens. If you can, dim lights and exhale fully before you begin.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a simple breath rhythm:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold 1, exhale slowly for 6. Repeat for 10 cycles. Feel your shoulders melt each round.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a body scan:</strong> Move attention from your scalp to your toes, relaxing each area. If thoughts arise, greet them kindly and return to your breath.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor it daily:</strong> Do this once mid‑afternoon or right before bed — the same time each day trains your body to downshift naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional upgrade:</strong> On tougher days, try a 10‑minute guided yoga nidra track to deepen the reset.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Easier falling asleep within a week, morning calm instead of rush, fewer “heart‑racing” moments when stressed.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Your habit of doom scrolling can undo this calm. Quick fix: put your phone in another room 15 min before practice and start your breathing instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one slow breath at a time, Eva. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost is about bringing your body’s internal signals back into rhythm through gentle, daily habits that support balanced hormones and calm steady growth. Think of it as giving your follicles a peaceful, predictable environment so they can focus on regrowing strong strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, you’re in the stabilization phase—shedding has eased but stress hormones are still calling the shots. Because your PCOS and long-running stress keep cortisol and insulin slightly off-sync, hormone balance is your “big domino.” Focusing here now helps your follicles shift from fragile recovery into active regrowth, setting up the stronger wave that usually shows around mid‑2025. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your mornings:</strong> Get outside or near daylight within 30 min of waking to help your circadian rhythm regulate cortisol and estrogen balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Protein at breakfast:</strong> Aim for 25–30 g of protein first thing. It steadies blood sugar and supports hormone production and hair builder amino acids.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening wind‑down breaks:</strong> Swap late “doom scrolling” for a 10‑minute stretch or journal pause to lower the adrenaline loop before bed.</li>\n<li><strong>Cycle-friendly meals:</strong> Include iron‑rich foods (lentils, spinach, poultry) 3–4× a week to offset past low‑iron findings and support estrogen metabolism.</li>\n<li><strong>Track & reflect:</strong> Jot down energy, mood, and shedding notes weekly; noticing small improvements keeps motivation alive.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer mid‑day crashes, steadier moods, and slightly silkier texture at the crown within 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If late‑night phone time sneaks back, cortisol stays high; fix it by plugging in your phone across the room 30 min before sleep.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds quiet confidence—each balanced day tells your body: “It’s safe to grow again.” 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you treat rest as a daily skill — learning how to prime your brain and body so every minute of sleep actually restores you. When your deep and REM cycles lengthen naturally, repair hormones and hair-growth signals can finally work uninterrupted.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is easing, but your follicles still feel the echo of long-term stress. Because night-shift rhythms and emotional strain are ongoing, improving your sleep efficiency is the “big domino.” Mastering this one habit now steadies cortisol, nurtures your new baby hairs, and shortens the time from fragile regrowth to stronger strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your wake-up time.</strong> Pick a time you can hold within 15 minutes daily, even on days off. This steady signal tells your circadian rhythm when to raise energy and when to calm it later.</li>\n<li><strong>Expose your eyes to natural light.</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, get at least 5–10 minutes of outdoor light. Morning daylight resets your internal clock and deepens the next night’s sleep cycles.</li>\n<li><strong>Move early, unwind late.</strong> Schedule movement or exercise before 4 p.m. whenever possible; it trains your body to wind down more easily at night.</li>\n<li><strong>Dim and disconnect.</strong> Two hours before bed, change your lighting to warm tones and stop stressful screen tasks. Let your senses know: “day is done.”</li>\n<li><strong>Nap smart.</strong> If shift work forces late nights, power-nap for 20 minutes before your shift—never after sunrise the next day—to protect nighttime sleep pressure.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster without scrolling, feeling clearer during morning light exposure, and noticing steadier moods by the end of week two.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-night doom scrolling keeps stress hormones high; plug your phone in across the room after your “dim and disconnect” window to avoid that trap.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one sound night at a time, Eva. 🌙 Your follicles feel every calm hour you claim back.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Bring Your Body Back to Safety 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Eva, you’re now in the stabilization phase — the hardest part is behind you. Because your emotional and chronic stress are still ongoing, this week’s focus is to help your body feel safe enough to pause the “alarm mode” that kept your follicles shedding. You’re already seeing baby hairs, which means your scalp is listening; it just needs steady signals through rest, rhythm, and calm.</p>\n  <p>When stress hormones stay high, they nudge follicles to stay in the shed phase. The practices this week — anchoring your sleep, winding down gently, and optimizing your bedroom — all tell your nervous system that the threat has passed. Deep, predictable sleep lowers cortisol, restores thyroid and estrogen balance, and boosts growth hormone that repairs follicle cells overnight. With your late bedtime shifts and only one high‑protein meal a day, this structure gives your body the stability it’s been missing.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calms cortisol:</strong> signals safety so shedding slows and stabilizes</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deepens sleep:</strong> supports hormone balance and follicle repair</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Resets rhythm:</strong> consistent bed/wake times rebuild your body clock</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Prepares for regrowth:</strong> nourishes the foundation for thicker strands ahead</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you anchor your sleep, you teach your body that it’s safe to grow again — one calm evening at a time 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
