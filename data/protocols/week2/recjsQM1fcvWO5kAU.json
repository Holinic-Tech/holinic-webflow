{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Mental Resilience Training teaches your nervous system to settle through slow breathing or guided relaxation, so your body can shift from stress mode into repair mode — the space where healthy hair growth begins.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Julia, you’ve moved from the chaotic peak of shedding into steady stabilization. Your follicles are safe, but low iron earlier this year left them cautious. Calming your stress loop now is the “big domino” that helps nutrients reach the roots faster and keeps the regrowth phase steady as your body restores balance toward early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose one quiet spot in your home and sit or lie down comfortably. Silence notifications.</li>\n<li>Inhale gently through your nose for a count of 4, hold for 2, exhale slowly for 6. Repeat for 10 rounds.</li>\n<li>Afterward, place one hand on your belly, one on your chest, and notice the warmth spreading — that’s your parasympathetic system switching on.</li>\n<li>If thoughts race, silently say “I’m safe and growing” with each breath out. Two minutes is enough to start.</li>\n<li>Mark it right after dinner or before bed—it anchors calm at the same time each night.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> falling asleep faster, waking with steadier energy, fewer stress-driven food urges, or simply noticing your shoulders drop sooner when you exhale.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping practice on “busy” days — that’s exactly when your body needs it most. Quick fix: do just three breaths before checking messages.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one centered breath at a time, Julia. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you catch those quiet moments when stress nudges you toward emotional eating—and replace them with choices that actually restore calm and support steady hair growth.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Julia, you’re in your stabilization phase—shedding has steadied, yet new growth is still gearing up. Because low iron slowed your recovery, keeping blood sugar and stress balanced is your “big domino.” Learning to soothe without food lightens cortisol’s pull and nourishes the ground your follicles need to begin regrowing by early 2026.</p>\n<h3>Step‑by‑step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Notice the cue:</strong> When you feel the urge to snack from stress or boredom, pause and name the emotion out loud—“I feel tense” or “I’m drained.”</li>\n<li><strong>Change the ritual:</strong> Step away from the kitchen. Try a 5‑minute walk, gentle stretching, or sipping warm tea while breathing slowly through your nose for four counts in, four out.</li>\n<li><strong>Nourish intentionally:</strong> Plan a balanced snack ahead of time—something with protein and iron (like an egg or a few almonds with fruit)—so eating becomes fueling, not coping.</li>\n<li><strong>Celebrate one victory daily:</strong> Each evening, jot down one moment you redirected the habit. Small wins retrain your brain’s comfort loop.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll feel clearer mid‑afternoon instead of “crashy,” your nighttime munching will drop, and mood swings between meals will flatten within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night scrolling can sneak back in and rekindle snacking urges—set your phone to “Do Not Disturb” after 9 p.m. and move it out of reach.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one calm craving swap at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Hormonal Health Boost helps you create small daily habits that keep your hormones in rhythm—so your scalp, mood, and energy all start working with you instead of against you.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Julia, your shedding has steadied after its spring peak, yet regrowth hasn’t fully begun. Because your iron has been low in the past and your periods are heavy, gentle hormone and mineral balance is your “big domino.” Supporting this now—during stabilization—helps your follicles build the reserves they’ll need for regrowth early next year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start your day with protein + iron synergy:</strong> Eat a protein-rich breakfast (like eggs or Greek yogurt) with vitamin C‑rich fruit to help iron absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep blood sugar steady:</strong> Include protein or healthy fat with each meal to prevent mid‑day crashes that can unsettle hormone signals.</li>\n<li><strong>Cycle‑friendly rest:</strong> On days your period is heavy, add 15 min of extra rest or gentle stretching instead of workouts that deplete you.</li>\n<li><strong>Track subtle cues:</strong> Note changes in cycle regularity, cravings, or energy—they’re early signs your hormones are finding balance.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Slightly lighter or more predictable periods, steadier afternoon energy, and improved mood balance within 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Emotional eating after stressful days can swing blood sugar—try a warm tea or short walk before reaching for sweets.</li>\n<li>Patience is your superpower now. Each balanced meal and calm evening tells your body it’s safe to grow again—one steady rhythm at a time. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Help Your Body Feel Safe Again 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Julia, you’re now in the <em>stabilization</em> phase — shedding has steadied after its spring peak, and your main trigger (low iron deficiency, now resolved) is no longer holding your follicles back. This week is about teaching your body that it’s safe to stay in balance so your energy can shift from survival to repair.</p>\n  <p>Your sleep rhythm is already pretty strong — 7–8 hours with only occasional wakings — so the goal isn’t to overhaul it, but to deepen it. The practices this week (anchoring your bedtime, winding down gently, and optimizing your bedroom) help regulate cortisol and rebuild the nightly growth signals that iron deficiency once muted. When cortisol stays low overnight, your body releases more growth hormone, repairs micro-inflammation around follicles, and stabilizes hair cycling.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Restore calm signals:</strong> steady bedtime cues tell your nervous system it’s safe to shift out of “stress mode.”</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balance hormones:</strong> consistent sleep cycles support thyroid and iron metabolism that fuel follicle energy.</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Prime follicles for regrowth:</strong> deeper sleep boosts nutrient delivery and sets up the first baby hairs expected early 2026.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm evening routine is a quiet message to your body: the danger has passed — it’s time to grow again 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
