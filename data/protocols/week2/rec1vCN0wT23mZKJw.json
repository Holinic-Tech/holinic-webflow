Because your chronic stress is still ongoing, this week is about building the daily signals that tell your body, “it’s safe to stop over-shedding.” These first practices are the big domino: once your nervous system steadies, your follicles can finally shift gears toward recovery.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your survey showed 7–8 hours of sleep but with 2–3 night wakings, late caffeine, and shift work layered on top of high stress and no coping outlet. That mix keeps cortisol elevated, which keeps hair stuck in shed mode. By setting a consistent sleep anchor, winding down gently, and fencing off late caffeine, you reduce that stress load, restore nightly hormone rhythms, and give your scalp the message it’s been waiting for.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> lowers the “alarm signal” that drives ongoing shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm repair:</strong> steadier sleep-wake cycles mean steadier follicle cycles</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> more time in deep sleep turns on repair and growth signals</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Stress buffer:</strong> small daily routines build resilience against chronic stressors</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you anchor your sleep and protect your evenings, you move closer to calmer shedding and the beginnings of regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
