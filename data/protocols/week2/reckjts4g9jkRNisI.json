Because your chronic stress is still ongoing, this first week is about giving your body the clearest signal possible that it’s safe to move out of “alarm mode” and into recovery. These practices are designed to calm the stress loop and lock in the steady environment your hair needs to hold on to new growth.</p>\n  <p>Right now, the “big domino” is restoring rhythm through sleep. With 6–7 hours a night, bedtime drifting by 30–60 minutes, and 2–3 night wakings, your stress system hasn’t been able to fully switch off. Anchoring sleep and winding down consistently tells your body to lower cortisol, release growth hormone during deep rest, and allow fragile regrowing strands to stay put instead of being pushed out too soon. Optimizing your bedroom isn’t just comfort — it’s creating a signal to your nervous system that it’s safe to repair.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> steadier sleep lowers cortisol so follicles aren’t stuck in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm:</strong> consistent rest balances the daily cycles that control hair growth</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Repair window:</strong> deep sleep releases growth hormone, fueling new hair cell activity</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Energy support:</strong> better nights give you calm, steady energy to handle stressors without setback</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your routine, you’re not just improving sleep — you’re teaching your body it’s safe to regrow, one baby hair at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
