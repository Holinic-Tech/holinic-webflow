It teaches your body to exhale tension so your scalp and hormones can exhale too.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, you’re in the early regrowth phase—shedding is easing, and baby hairs are showing. But perimenopause can still cause flickers of stress that disrupt sleep and hormones. Building mental steadiness right now is your big domino: each calm breath steadies cortisol and allows those fragile new hairs to anchor and thicken as you move toward full stabilization.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your anchor time:</strong> Set aside 10 minutes before bed or after waking—same time daily.</li>\n<li><strong>Center your breath:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, exhale for 6. Continue for 10 cycles, letting the exhale lengthen naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Add stillness:</strong> After breathing, close your eyes and imagine warmth spreading across your scalp—just notice sensations without judgment.</li>\n<li><strong>Reset during the day:</strong> When stress rises, place a hand over your heart and repeat three slower breaths before reacting.</li>\n<li><strong>Track calm:</strong> Note how easily you fall asleep or how steady your energy feels after practice for one week.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week; mellower mood through the evening; waking up once less per night.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping sessions on busy nights—you tend to get only 5–6h sleep, so protect this as your cue to wind down again. Try pairing practice with brushing teeth so it becomes automatic.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each quiet session tells your body, “You’re safe now,” and that safety is what lets regrowth flourish. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you spot the quiet patterns that pull you off track when stress hits — so instead of slipping into old loops, you redirect that moment into recovery for your body and hair.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, your shedding has eased and baby hairs are sprouting — that’s the start of regrowth. At this stage, stress response still influences your hormonal balance, especially through perimenopause. This practice is your “big domino” because breaking small self‑sabotage cycles keeps cortisol steady, protecting those fragile new hairs and helping them anchor through the next stabilization window.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Catch your cue:</strong> Notice one daily moment when frustration or fatigue kicks in (for many it’s late afternoon or before bed).</li>\n<li><strong>Name the automatic urge:</strong> Write the typical reaction — maybe scrolling, snacking, or skipping wind‑down time.</li>\n<li><strong>Insert a 2‑minute swap:</strong> Replace that habit with slow breathing, a short walk, or a favorite piece of calming music — anything that shifts your body out of tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor the win:</strong> Each time you choose the swap, jot a tick in your notes. Seeing those marks trains your brain to associate calm with reward.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect weekly:</strong> Sunday evening, review how many times you caught yourself and celebrate even small improvements.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer evening tension spikes, steadier mood within a week, and easier fall‑asleep time as your body stops riding stress waves.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> You mentioned late‑night wake‑ups — avoid checking your phone if you wake; instead, deep‑breathe for one minute and roll gently to your side.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds resilience, Bo — one swapped pattern at a time, you’re extending the calm your new hairs need to thrive. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps your body restore balance during mid‑life transitions by supporting the daily habits that keep your estrogen, cortisol, and sleep rhythms steady — without medication or complicated testing.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, you’re in the early regrowth stage — the shedding storm has passed and those new baby hairs mean your follicles are responding again. With menopause changes still ongoing, this is the single biggest domino: stabilizing your hormones so those fragile sprouts strengthen into resilient strands. By reinforcing balance now, you’ll move smoothly through the rest of regrowth and keep shedding low as you head toward spring stability.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your first meal:</strong> Within one hour of waking, eat 20–30 g of protein (e.g., eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu) to steady blood sugar and cortisol.</li>\n<li><strong>Midday reset:</strong> Step outside for at least 5 minutes of sunlight between 11 am–1 pm to support circadian hormone rhythms.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening wind‑down:</strong> Begin dimming lights an hour before bed and stretch or meditate — these calm cortisol before sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Consistent bedtime:</strong> Aim to keep sleep and wake times within 30 minutes daily; this anchors your hormonal clock and improves growth signaling overnight.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your energy:</strong> Note when you feel most focused or sluggish — recognizing your body’s new rhythm helps you plan meals and rest around it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Morning energy steadier; fewer hot flashes; scalp feels less tight or reactive within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or late‑night scrolling can spike cortisol and undo balance — keep phone charging outside your room as a cue to disconnect.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Setting the Stage for Steady Regrowth 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Bo, you’re entering the early regrowth phase — shedding has eased, baby hairs are showing, and your body is beginning to rebuild after a long hormonal rollercoaster. Because your main trigger, ongoing perimenopause, is still active, this week is all about creating stability so your follicles feel “safe” to stay in growth mode. Think of it as giving your body the quiet, predictable rhythm it needs to keep recovery moving forward.</p>\n  <p>With just 5–6 hours of sleep and a few nightly wakings, your system hasn’t been getting the deep rest that balances cortisol and supports hormone repair. The practices this week — setting a consistent sleep anchor, winding down calmly, and making your bedroom a true rest zone — are the big dominoes. When you calm the stress loop at night, your body lowers cortisol, restores melatonin and growth hormones, and allows follicles to shift fully back into their active phase.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> lowers daily stress load that keeps shedding signals active</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormone balance:</strong> steadier estrogen and progesterone cues for stronger roots</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Improves follicle recovery:</strong> deep sleep releases growth factors that rebuild hair cells</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Boosts resilience:</strong> better sleep makes you less reactive to ongoing hormone changes</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you help your body move from fragile regrowth to lasting strength — one calm evening at a time 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
