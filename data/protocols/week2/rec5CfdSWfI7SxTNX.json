{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Mental Resilience Training is a short daily practice of calming your nervous system through guided breathing or meditation, so your body spends less time in “fight or flight” and more energy on restoring healthy hair growth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase: shedding is still unsettling, but your baby hairs show your follicles are active. Because your chronic illness is still flaring, your system easily slips into stress mode. Training resilience acts like a buffer — steadying your body so it can shift out of high-alert and give space for stronger regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a set time each evening — ideally after your last screen use — to dedicate just 5–10 minutes.</li>\n    <li>Sit or lie somewhere quiet, place one hand on your belly, and breathe in for 4 counts, out for 6 counts. Repeat for 10 cycles.</li>\n    <li>If thoughts intrude, gently guide your attention back to the rise and fall of your belly.</li>\n    <li>Optional: On extra tense days, try a 10‑minute guided yoga nidra or meditation audio before bed.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You may notice falling asleep faster, waking up fewer times at night, or feeling calmer during the day within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late caffeine makes it harder for your nervous system to downshift. Quick fix: set a “last cup” cutoff by 2 pm.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Self-Sabotage Buster is about spotting those little habits that quietly drain your progress — and replacing them with tiny, nourishing practices that help your body feel steadier and safer.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase — your shedding is still active, but your follicles are capable of regrowth (you’ve already seen baby hairs!). Right now, your ongoing illness flare makes your body more sensitive to stress signals. By gently removing the hidden habits that keep your system on “high alert,” you’re giving your scalp the calm foundation it needs before regrowth takes off in a few months.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Identify your default “soother” when stress hits — whether it’s that evening glass of wine, scrolling late, or another quick fix.</li>\n    <li>Pair it with a healthier swap: a short guided meditation, a warm shower, or writing just one line in a journal.</li>\n    <li>Anchor your swap to the same trigger (e.g., instead of sipping wine after dinner, brew a calming herbal tea).</li>\n    <li>Set a reminder before your usual weak spot time (like 9 p.m.) so you interrupt autopilot before it starts.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling less groggy when waking, noticing calmer digestion or steadier evening moods, and slightly deeper sleep within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Caffeine after 3 p.m. is still slipping in for you — it can raise night wakings. Quick fix: keep your favorite tea or water bottle ready so you don’t reach for coffee out of habit.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — even a single small swap signals your body, “you’re safe now,” and that safety is what lets regrowth take root. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Hormonal Health Boost is about tuning into your cycle signals and giving your body the steady rhythm it needs, so your hormones can support calmer shedding and healthier regrowth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Right now you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is still unsettling, but about to plateau. Because your cycles are irregular and you’ve had heavy health stress this year, your hormones need steadier support.

Because your chronic illness flare is ongoing, your system is under persistent stress signals, which makes this week’s focus extra important. By stabilizing your daily rhythms, you’re giving your follicles the clear message that it’s safe to shift out of survival mode.</p>\n  <p>Right now, the “big domino” is restoring predictability to your sleep and stress rhythms. With 6–7 hours of broken sleep, 2–3 night wakings, and late caffeine or alcohol a few nights per week, your cortisol and melatonin cycles are being tugged out of sync. These practices help calm that loop: lowering stress hormones, restoring growth hormone release in deep sleep, and providing steady signals that follicles can stay anchored instead of shedding early.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> lowers the stress signals that keep hair stuck in a shed-prone state</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> consistent sleep-wake cues help balance cycles disrupted by irregular periods</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle stability:</strong> deeper sleep supports repair and keeps baby hairs from stalling</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Energy restoration:</strong> better rest reduces fatigue from your ongoing flare, freeing resources for regrowth</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your bedtime, swap late caffeine for calm rituals, and wind down gently, you’re building the foundation for calmer shedding and visible sprouts ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
