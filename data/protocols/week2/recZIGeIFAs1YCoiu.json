A few quiet minutes re‑center your nervous system, so your body can stay in “repair mode” where hair follicles thrive.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, you’ve made it through the storm — hormonal and emotional shifts have settled, and tiny baby hairs are proof your follicles are waking up. At this regrowth‑start phase, regulating stress hormones is your big domino. Each calm breath helps your recovering scalp move from fragile stability toward steady, confident regrowth over the next few months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set aside 10 minutes</strong> — ideally morning or before bed, somewhere you won’t be interrupted.</li>\n<li><strong>Ground and breathe:</strong> Sit or lie comfortably. Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 2, then exhale through your mouth for 6. Repeat for 10 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Body scan reset:</strong> Bring awareness from toes to scalp, relaxing each area as you breathe out. Imagine warmth moving upward, signaling safety to every hair root.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor the calm:</strong> Right after, place a hand gently over your heart and think, “My body is healing; new growth is forming.”</li>\n<li><strong>Practice daily</strong> — pairing this with your wind‑down or morning routine builds powerful rhythm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling your shoulders drop faster when you start breathing; deeper, steadier sleep; less mid‑day tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If late‑day screen scrolling revs your mind again, leave your phone outside the room and keep a small notepad bedside to offload thoughts.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps your body find its rhythm again after hormonal changes. Each small daily habit in this practice steadies your signals so hair growth can stay “switched on” without the roadblocks of imbalance or stress.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, your shedding steadied after last year’s post‑pill dip, and those new baby hairs mean your regrowth phase just began. Right now, your hormones are recalibrating—this is your big domino. Supporting that balance helps each fresh strand stay anchored and thick as you move from early regrowth toward lasting density. Your job: give your system the consistency it’s been missing since the hormone shifts mid‑2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start your mornings with protein + calm:</strong> Within 60 minutes of waking, have a 20–30 g protein meal (think eggs, Greek yogurt, or a smoothie). It sets steady blood sugar and steadies your stress hormones for the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor your sleep-wake rhythm:</strong> Aim for the same bedtime and wake-up within 30 minutes daily. This keeps cortisol and melatonin in sync, both key for hormonal harmony and healthy growth cycles.</li>\n<li><strong>Rebuild your mineral base:</strong> Include iron-rich foods (lentils, spinach, lean meats) three times a week. Since you’ve had low iron before, this fuels oxygen to new follicles.</li>\n<li><strong>Light movement beats intensity:</strong> Try a 30‑minute walk or gentle yoga four days per week. It smooths hormone signaling without spiking stress hormones.</li>\n<li><strong>Cycle check‑in:</strong> Note mood shifts or changes in your period for two months—patterns reveal if your body’s balance is holding steady.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy mid‑afternoon, smoother moods around your cycle, and fewer hairs left on your comb within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast (especially after caffeine) can send stress hormones soaring—fix it by pairing your coffee with a small protein snack if a full meal isn’t possible.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—your hormones love routine, and so do your follicles. Keep stacking these quiet wins, one balanced day at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p><strong>Professional Sleeper</strong> helps you train your body to sleep like it’s your job — with deep, restorative rest that supports hormone balance and strong hair growth. It’s about creating the inner conditions where your scalp and follicles can finally focus on repair.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, you’ve just entered the <em>regrowth start</em> phase — your shedding has eased and those new baby hairs mean recovery is underway. But hormonal shifts from coming off birth control still need calm, consistent sleep to keep regrowth steady. Solid seven‑hour nights are your “big domino” now: they normalize cortisol and rebuild your growth rhythm as you move further from last year’s stress window.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Keep the light honest:</strong> Get at least 5–10 minutes of outdoor light within an hour of waking. It locks your body clock for the day and helps you fall asleep naturally at night.</li>\n<li><strong>Guard your sleep midpoint:</strong> Aim for your sleep window to straddle the hours between roughly 11 p.m.–7 a.m. Keep wake‑up within 30 min even on weekends.</li>\n<li><strong>Prioritize wind‑down silence:</strong> In the last 30 minutes before bed, no decisions, notifications, or screens that pull emotional energy. Let your brain idle down.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature cue:</strong> Drop your room or body temp slightly before bed — a short cool rinse or a fan change can trigger natural melatonin release.</li>\n<li><strong>Morning anchor:</strong> Move your body lightly within the first hour after waking (stretch, walk, short yoga). It reinforces last night’s hormonal reset.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You start waking easier, no heavy “hungover” feeling; mood steadier through afternoon; fewer random sheds in the brush by week two.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Midday screen overload can push your sleep window later — if you scroll long past lunch, schedule a 15‑min light break outdoors to reset your rhythm.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one great night of sleep at a time. 🌙 Your follicles will thank you for every extra minute of true rest.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steadying Your Foundation for Regrowth 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Ana, you’ve moved into the early regrowth phase—shedding has steadied, and those fine baby hairs are your first sign of recovery. After the post‑pill hormonal shift that began in May 2025, your body is finally settling. This week is about helping that stability hold, so your follicles feel “safe” to keep growing stronger strands.</p>\n  <p>Your sleep rhythm is already fairly consistent (6–7 hours, minimal night wakings), which gives us a solid base to build on. The practices this week—anchoring your bedtime, winding down fully, and optimizing your sleep space—are designed to reinforce hormonal balance and lower lingering cortisol from last year’s stress period. Deep, predictable rest is what allows your body to reroute nutrients and growth signals back toward your scalp.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol calm:</strong> steadier stress hormones mean fewer “shed” signals sent to follicles</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> supports recovery after the post‑pill transition</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Growth phase protection:</strong> preserves fragile new hairs as they anchor in</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Night‑time repair:</strong> boosts collagen and scalp circulation during deep sleep</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you strengthen the message your body already started sending: it’s time to rebuild—one calm, nourished strand at a time. 🌱</em></p>\n</div>"}}
