{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Mental Resilience Training helps you calm inner tension through short, restorative breathing or meditation sessions, so your body spends more time in “repair mode” — the state where follicles quietly reset and growth can resume.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Gry, you’re in the stabilization phase — follicles are steadier but still sensitive. Chronic stress has been your longest‑running trigger, and the hormonal shifts of menopause can amplify that tension. This practice is your “big domino”: mastering calm in your body helps your scalp move from holding on in defense to opening up for regrowth as spring approaches. Think of it as the daily signal telling your hair: it’s safe to grow again.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a daily 10‑minute anchor:</strong> Pick one consistent time (morning or before bed) when you can be undisturbed.</li>\n  <li><strong>Try the 4‑6 breath:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, exhale slowly for 6. Repeat for two minutes, eyes closed, shoulders down.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add body awareness:</strong> As you breathe, scan from crown to toes and notice any clenched areas softening.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use a quiet cue:</strong> Finish with one word that feels grounding — “ease,” “flow,” or any you choose — to link calm with your scalp.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional:</strong> On restless evenings, listen to a gentle yoga nidra track before sleep to deepen the stress reset.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> A calmer heart rate during the day, easier drift‑off at bedtime, and fewer “wave days” of sudden shedding or scalp tightness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑day caffeine (after 3 pm) can blunt the relaxation response — keep your final cup before lunch or switch to herbal tea.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one intentional breath at a time, your nervous system learns safety again, and your hair follows. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you spot the small habits that quietly drain your energy and replace them with steady rituals that calm your system. It’s about learning to step out of old stress loops and give your scalp‑body axis a real chance to recover.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Gry, you’re in the stabilization phase — that tender space where hair cycles can finally reset, but only if your stress hormones stay balanced. Because chronic stress has been your main trigger since long before shedding began, this practice is your big domino: reshaping how you respond to pressure now helps your follicles hold their rhythm and sets you up for visible regrowth in the coming months. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Identify your drainers.</strong> Write down the top two situations or habits that leave you tense or depleted (e.g., saying yes when you mean no, skipping meals during long workdays).</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair each with a swap.</strong> For every drainer, choose one calming or nourishing counter‑habit — five deep breaths, a short walk, or a 2‑minute stretch before you check messages.</li>\n  <li><strong>Use your meditation skill.</strong> Each time stress spikes, pause and breathe into the body area that tightens first. Let it soften before reacting.</li>\n  <li><strong>End the day with a check‑in.</strong> Note one moment when you chose a better response. Tiny self‑wins reinforce the new wiring.</li>\n  <li><strong>Repeat for one full week.</strong> Consistency, not perfection, is what resets old patterns.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice your shoulders drop more often, post‑work craving or snacking eases, and your evening wind‑down feels lighter within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑day caffeine can sneak back during tough weeks — if that happens, switch to herbal tea after 3 pm and stretch for five breaths instead of grabbing coffee.</li>\n  <li>Stay gentle but steady, Gry. Each moment you interrupt an old stress loop, you teach your body safety again — and safe follicles grow strong. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Hormonal Health Boost helps you steady your internal rhythms—the subtle daily cues that keep estrogen, cortisol, and sleep hormones in sync—so your follicles stay nourished and responsive again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Gry, you’re in the stabilization phase, where your scalp is ready to reawaken but still sensitive to hormonal and stress ups and downs. With perimenopause and chronic stress both active triggers, balancing these signals is your “big domino.” This practice will quiet the waves of shedding and build the inner steadiness that opens the door to visible regrowth in the coming months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your mornings:</strong> Get 5–10 minutes of natural light soon after waking. This retunes your body clock and supports balanced cortisol and estrogen patterns.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat protein within an hour of waking:</strong> Aim for at least 25–30 g (e.g., eggs with smoked salmon or Greek yogurt plus nuts). This gives your follicles raw material to grow and steadies blood sugar swings that stress hormones.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep caffeine before 2 p.m.:</strong> Your late-afternoon coffee blunts evening melatonin, which disrupts hormone repair work at night. Move it earlier and notice calmer sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Wind down on purpose:</strong> Dim lights an hour before bed, stretch or breathe deeply for 5 minutes. This drop in mental noise tells your hormone network “safety, shift to restoration.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More predictable energy across the day, less mid‑afternoon tension, and steadier sleep within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or relying on caffeine to push through fatigue can spike stress hormones; fix by preparing your protein source the night before.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—every balanced morning is a quiet signal to your follicles that stability has arrived. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Bringing Your Body Back Into Balance 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Gry, you’re in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — the point where your follicles are trying to find steady ground after long waves of shedding. Because your <strong>chronic stress is still ongoing</strong> and perimenopausal shifts continue, this week is about calming the internal “alarm” that keeps your scalp in a holding pattern. The practices here—anchoring sleep, winding down properly, and fencing caffeine—are the first levers that tell your body it’s safe to move from survival into repair.</p>\n  <p>When you sleep deeply and consistently, cortisol levels fall, growth hormones rise, and the nightly repair cycle restarts. Late caffeine or shift work can quietly disrupt that rhythm, keeping follicles in stress mode. By giving your system predictable rest and calmer evenings, you’re helping the stress axis reset and letting your scalp’s microcirculation and nutrient delivery run smoothly again.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets stress hormones:</strong> consistent sleep lowers cortisol that blocks regrowth signals</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances perimenopausal rhythms:</strong> steadier rest supports estrogen and progesterone balance</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Boosts follicle recovery:</strong> growth hormone released in deep sleep fuels new hair cells</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Improves resilience:</strong> better rest makes you less reactive to daily stressors that trigger shed waves</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each evening you protect your wind‑down and caffeine boundary, you’re quietly teaching your body safety—and every night of safety brings you closer to calmer shedding and visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
