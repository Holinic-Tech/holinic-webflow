Chronic stress from caregiving and the hormonal changes since last summer keep your body on high alert. Learning to downshift your stress—just a few minutes a day—can steady shedding and prepare your scalp for new growth as spring approaches. This is your “big domino” right now. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Create a quiet daily pocket.</strong> Choose the same fifteen‑minute slot each day—right after work or before bed.</li>\n<li><strong>Settle your breath.</strong> Sit or lie down, place one hand on your chest and one on your belly. Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, exhale slowly through your mouth for 6. Repeat for 10 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Practice release.</strong> As thoughts intrude, notice the tension in your body and exhale it away. Say quietly, “I’m safe now.”</li>\n<li><strong>Layer calm signals.</strong> End with a stretch—shoulders, neck, or legs—to complete the stress cycle before you move on.</li>\n<li><strong>Record your calm.</strong> Mark a ✅ in your journal each time you finish. Tiny streaks create big shifts.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Better quality sleep within a week, lighter emotional reactivity to daily stressors, and a calmer scalp sensation after wind‑down.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping sessions on high‑stress days (the very days you need them most). Quick fix—tie the practice to an existing habit, like brushing teeth or shutting your laptop.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one slow breath, one calm night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you interrupt stress loops before they show up in your scalp, replacing “quick comfort” habits with ones that actually calm your system and rebuild balance.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re in your stabilization phase — your body is still adjusting to the hormonal change started last summer, and chronic stress is keeping your shedding a bit unpredictable. Because high stress and emotional eating drain nutrients and spike cortisol, this is your big domino: mastering gentler coping means your body can finally shift toward true regrowth by spring. This week, we’ll train your nervous system to find calm without self‑sabotaging your progress.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Pause and name it.</strong> When a craving or stress wave hits, stop for ten seconds and quietly say what’s happening (“I’m anxious from work emails”). That naming breaks autopilot.</li>\n  <li><strong>Swap the outlet.</strong> Choose one quick, body‑based release: a short walk, 10 deep belly breaths, or sipping water while stretching your shoulders.</li>\n  <li><strong>Refuel, don’t punish.</strong> If you’re truly hungry, pair a protein snack (boiled egg, Greek yogurt, handful of nuts) with something soothing like warm tea — not sugar or chips.</li>\n  <li><strong>Evening ritual check‑in.</strong> Before bed, jot one trigger moment and one small win. Seeing the pattern builds awareness and resilience.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Cravings or stress snacking feel less urgent; your mood steadies between meals; you notice fewer “spiral” nights where worries keep looping.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If long work shifts steal your pause moments, set a phone reminder labeled “60‑second reset.” Small, repeated breaks rewire faster than one big one.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm choice at a time, and your scalp will feel it too. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you rebalance your internal rhythms so your scalp, skin, and energy can finally stabilize. It’s about nudging your body back into harmony through small, daily actions—no prescriptions needed.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re in the stabilization phase—your body is still adjusting to the hormonal treatment from last summer while managing ongoing stress. This practice is your “big domino”: as your hormones and stress hormones calm, shedding eases and regrowth can begin by spring. Think of it as giving your follicles the steady environment they’ve been waiting for after months of hormonal turbulence.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor nourishment:</strong> Start every day with a protein-rich breakfast (20–30 g). This signals safety to your metabolism and steadies hormones that influence shedding.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep your iron topped up:</strong> Pair iron sources (like lentils, red meat, or spinach) with vitamin C foods and avoid tea/coffee 1 hour around those meals for better absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Support your rhythm:</strong> Aim for sleep between 10 p.m.–6 a.m. whenever possible. Even if your work shifts vary, keep bedtime within a one‑hour window on most nights.</li>\n  <li><strong>Tame stress surges:</strong> Each afternoon, take a 5‑minute pause—slow breathing or light stretching—to lower cortisol spikes that can disrupt hormonal recovery.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track calm consistency:</strong> Use your journal or notes app to log energy, mood, and shedding twice a week. You’ll begin to spot your pattern smoothing out.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy across the day, less bloating before your period, and shedding that feels slightly less dramatic on wash days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast when busy—this can trigger energy crashes and worsen stress hormones. Quick fix: keep boiled eggs or a protein shake ready to grab.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—every stable meal, restful night, and calm pause is telling your body, “It’s safe to grow again.” 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steady Ground First — Calming the Storm So Growth Can Begin 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Marilou, you’re now in the stabilization phase — that in‑between space where shedding is still happening but your body is slowly finding balance after the post‑pill change last July. Because both your hormones and chronic stress are still active, this week is about signaling safety to your system. When your body senses “I’m safe,” it stops prioritizing survival and can start protecting hair again.</p>\n  <p>With your 5–6 hours of sleep and shifting bedtimes, your stress hormones are likely staying elevated overnight. The practices this week — anchoring a bedtime, winding down properly, and optimizing your sleep space — are your “big domino.” They lower nighttime cortisol, restore hormone rhythm, and let your follicles exit their shed mode. Deep sleep also triggers growth signals that can’t fire when you’re running on adrenaline.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> calms the stress loop driving ongoing shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances hormones:</strong> supports recovery from your post‑pill adjustment</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deep sleep repair:</strong> boosts growth hormone and scalp circulation</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Creates safety signals:</strong> tells your body it’s okay to shift toward regrowth</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you’re teaching your body that the danger has passed — and that’s when shedding finally eases and recovery begins 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
