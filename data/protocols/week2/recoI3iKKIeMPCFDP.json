Repeat for five cycles.</li>\n<li><strong>Add body awareness:</strong> After your last exhale, notice the weight of your body, your heartbeat easing, your scalp softening.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor daily:</strong> Practice once in the morning and again before bed—pair it with brushing teeth or skincare so it becomes instinctive.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional deep rest:</strong> Once or twice a week, try a 10‑minute yoga nidra or guided body scan (audio only, eyes closed).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice calmer mornings, fewer racing thoughts at bedtime, and more consistent sleep within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If you end up scrolling before bed, your mind won’t fully unwind—try setting phone-down time 20 minutes earlier.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one steady breath at a time, your hair and energy both learn to feel safe again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you spot the tiny habits that quietly work against your hair recovery — and swap them for stress‑relievers that actually restore your system.

Master this, and you’ll smooth the path from recovery to thicker regrowth. 🌿</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Notice your triggers.</strong> When your mind starts looping on worries, pause for one deep breath before reacting — awareness breaks the old pattern.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap the response.</strong> Instead of intensifying workouts or scrolling, choose a calming 5‑minute reset: a slow walk, grounded breathing, or writing out your thoughts and closing the notebook.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor it.</strong> Do your chosen reset at the same cue each day (post‑workout stretch or bedtime wind‑down) so it becomes second nature.</li>\n<li><strong>Nourish inside.</strong> Pair your coping swap with a balanced snack rich in protein or iron to reassure your system it’s safe and replenished.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect weekly.</strong> Note one moment you handled stress differently — this proof rewires confidence in your ability to calm your body’s hair‑protective systems.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> A lighter feeling in your chest after stressful days, steadier energy through the afternoon, and less scalp tightness or tingling as stress hormones settle.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Watch the late‑evening worry scroll on your phone — it reinflames stress chemistry. Quick fix: plug it in across the room 30 min before bed.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one small pause, one calmer breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently recalibrate your hormonal rhythms through daily habits—so your hair, mood, and energy stay steady as your body completes its healing and regrowth cycle.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rania, you’re in your regrowth phase—shedding has eased, and those new baby hairs prove your follicles are waking back up.
