{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Jeanne, your shedding is still worsening (~8 months after your February illness and spring stress). That timing is consistent with the “peak” phase of telogen effluvium. The big domino here is training your mind to down‑shift out of stress mode. Illness + emotional strain likely overloaded your stress hormones; by strengthening mental resilience now, you buffer cortisol and move toward stabilization → the stage where your hairs stop falling faster than they regrow. 🌱</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Set aside 10 minutes daily for guided breath practice or yoga nidra.</li> \n<li>Use a simple mantra or body‑scan to quiet looping thoughts before bed.</li> \n<li>Replace one workout per week with restorative movement (stretch, gentle yoga).</li> \n<li>Anchor practice to a fixed cue (morning light, post‑exercise, or just before sleep).</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Morning: 5 minutes of diaphragmatic breathing before breakfast.</li> \n<li>Mid‑day: 2 min pause—shoulders down, long exhales, eyes closed.</li> \n<li>Evening: 10–15 min guided yoga nidra or meditation in bed.</li> \n<li>Weekly: one long restorative session (~30 min) to reset the nervous system.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Pick your “anchor time” (e.g., right after brushing teeth at night) so practice becomes automatic.</li> \n<li>Sit or lie somewhere quiet; place one hand on chest, one on belly. Breathe in 4 counts, out 6 counts.</li> \n<li>When thoughts drift, gently repeat a calming word like “ease.”</li> \n<li>Use free audio of yoga nidra at bedtime if you need structured guidance.</li> \n<li>On tough days, even 2 minutes counts—consistency beats duration.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your stress trigger ended in June, but shedding worsens due to lag (3‑month hair cycle). Resilience practice minimizes ongoing cortisol “aftershocks.”</li> \n<li>Lower cortisol → steadier thyroid and progesterone tone → reduces telogen push.</li> \n<li>Night relaxation deepens slow‑wave sleep, where repair and growth cues rise.</li> \n<li>Since you eat late and have a past iron flag, calming the nervous system helps maximize nutrient use for regrowth instead of burning it on tension.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If stress spikes into panic or insomnia appears → scale back intensity and consider professional support.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 1–2 weeks you may notice calmer mood swings, quicker recovery after workouts, and slightly less morning shedding.</li> \n<li>Remember: your job is not perfection. It’s giving your body permission to settle so hair can catch up. ❤️</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Jeanne, your shedding is still worsening after illness + emotional stress earlier this year, which suggests you’re stuck in the “peak” phase. The big domino now is bringing your hormones into steadier balance so your follicles can finally move into stabilization. Because you already sleep well and avoid heavy alcohol/caffeine, your next leverage point is nutritional hormones and cycle support—iron, protein, and progesterone balance. This is what shifts you from crisis mode into the calm ground where regrowth can start. 🌱</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Add 1 iron‑rich source (lean red meat, lentils + vitamin C food) with lunch or dinner 3–4 days a week.</li> \n<li>Keep at least 2 high‑protein meals daily (20–30g each) to stabilise insulin and thyroid signals.</li> \n<li>Evening: aim for a lighter meal ≥2h before bed to keep overnight cortisol lower.</li> \n<li>Track PMS days; use gentle magnesium or yoga breathing that week to support progesterone tone.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Anchor: 2 protein‑dense meals + 1 iron‑rich dish each day.</li> \n<li>Mark cycle days on a calendar; note PMS shifts.</li> \n<li>Adjust dinner timing stepwise (90 → 120min before sleep).</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Start tomorrow: move dinner a little earlier—just 15–20 min at first.</li> \n<li>At lunch, choose chicken + beans, beef + salad, or tofu + quinoa.</li> \n<li>Add citrus or peppers with plant iron (lentils, spinach) to aid absorption.</li> \n<li>During PMS week, add a calming ritual post‑workout (stretch, bath, magnesium drink).</li> \n<li>Keep logging shedding roughly once a week to catch the stabilization window as it arrives.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because your shedding hasn’t stabilized, iron + protein sufficiency give follicles the raw materials to re‑enter growth after illness stress pushed them into telogen.</li> \n<li>Your emotional stress ended months ago; supporting luteal progesterone now reduces “mini‑spikes” from PMS that could otherwise prolong shedding.</li> \n<li>Aligning dinner earlier helps overnight cortisol drop, which protects melatonin’s repair signal to the follicle.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Dizziness, extreme fatigue, or very heavy periods could mean iron is still too low → bring this up at your next checkup.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Slightly thicker ponytail feel, shedding starts to plateau by weeks 4–6, PMS symptoms a bit easier.</li> \n<li>Keep reminding yourself: stabilization is victory—even before sprouts show, less daily loss is the first sign your follicles are ready to regrow. ❤️</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice3_html":null,"practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: "}}
