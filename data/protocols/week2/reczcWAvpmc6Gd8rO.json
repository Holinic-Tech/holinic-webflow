{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Mental Resilience Training helps you steady your mind and calm your body through simple practices like breathing or guided relaxation, so stress no longer fuels hair shedding behind the scenes.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in stabilization — the storm is easing, but your body is still catching up from dieting stress and short, broken sleep. Right now, building resilience is your “big domino”: it reduces nervous-system tension so your scalp has the calm, steady environment it needs to shift fully into regrowth. Think of this as clearing space for your baby hairs to thrive. 🌱</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Find a quiet spot, sit or lie comfortably, and set a 5–10 minute timer.</li>\n    <li>Close your eyes. Inhale slowly through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 1, exhale for 6.</li>\n    <li>If your mind races, gently bring it back to the rhythm of your breath — no judgment.</li>\n    <li>After your timer ends, open your eyes and stretch. Carry this calmer state into the rest of your day.</li>\n    <li>Optional: Try this once more before bed to support deeper, less fragmented sleep.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Slightly longer stretches of sleep overnight, feeling less reactive when stress hits, noticing fewer urges for stress-snacking.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> A late caffeine hit makes calming breathwork harder — place your caffeine “fence” at 2 p.m. to set yourself up for success.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady breath at a time. You don’t need to be perfect; you just need to keep showing up. 🌿</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Self-Sabotage Buster helps you replace habits that drain your energy (like stress eating) with calming, nourishing swaps that actually support your hair and body’s recovery.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in stabilization — your shedding is still active, but some baby hairs are already peeking through. Because restrictive dieting is still stressing your system, how you manage day-to-day urges matters hugely. Swapping stress-eating for kinder coping tools is your big domino: it lowers internal chaos, helps nutrients go where they need to, and steadies the ground for regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick one high-trigger moment (e.g., after a long day when you’d usually snack emotionally).</li>\n    <li>Pause for 90 seconds before reaching for food — breathe deeply, place a hand on your chest, and notice your body.</li>\n    <li>Redirect: choose one pre-decided alternative (short walk, herbal tea, journaling a single thought, or texting a friend).</li>\n    <li>If you still feel hungry after 10 minutes, build a balanced snack with protein + fiber (e.g., Greek yogurt with fruit).</li>\n    <li>Celebrate the win — jot it down so you see the streak add up.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling fewer guilt cycles around food, calmer evenings, and lighter stress “fog” within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-day caffeine (you reported drinking after 3 pm) can spike urges and worsen sleep. Quick fix: set a “caffeine curfew” by 2 pm.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one swap at a time, you’re freeing up energy your hair can use to grow stronger. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Hormonal Health Boost is a simple daily check-in and set of tiny adjustments to help rebalance your hormones naturally, giving your scalp the steady environment it needs for stronger growth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase: shedding has been intense, but baby hairs are already peeking through. Because your cycle is regular yet heavy and you’ve noticed acne and extra hair growth, hormone balance is likely playing a quiet but powerful role. By putting focus here, you’ll steady the “terrain” your follicles depend on — helping your scalp shift from survival mode toward real regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Track your cycle this month, noting heavy days, PMS shifts, or acne flare‑ups in a simple journal or app.</li>\n    <li>Add a consistent protein source to at least two meals a day (eggs, chicken, fish, lentils).</li>\n    <li>Support hormone balance with stable meal times — avoid long calorie gaps or skipped dinners.</li>\n    <li>Begin a mini stress-release ritual during PMS week (walk, journaling, or warm bath 15 min daily).</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More steady energy across your cycle, fewer “crazy hungry” evenings, or less breakout intensity around your period.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals after restrictive dieting is a common pitfall — if you slip, aim for a nourishing snack (nuts, yogurt, boiled eggs) instead of pushing through hunger.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — your scalp loves predictability.

Because your main trigger, rapid weight loss, is still ongoing, your body is extra sensitive to stress signals. That’s why this week’s practices focus on calming your system and giving your follicles the message: “it’s safe to hold onto hair again.”</p>\n  <p>Right now, your sleep is under pressure — less than 5 hours a night, 2–3 wake-ups, and caffeine later in the day. Sleep is where your stress hormone cortisol resets, growth hormone rises, and your follicles shift out of shed mode. By anchoring bedtime, winding down properly, and fencing caffeine, you’re removing the biggest blocks to recovery. Think of it as building the soil conditions your hair needs before regrowth can truly flourish.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress load:</strong> reduces cortisol spikes that prolong shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> steadier signals for your cycle and scalp</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deeper sleep cues follicles to stay in growth phase</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Energy restoration:</strong> more resilience to handle dieting stress without further loss</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you’re not just resting — you’re actively creating the conditions for calmer shedding and stronger regrowth to take root 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
