Your body is still completing repair from the May injury, so each calm breath helps redirect energy away from stress signals and back toward follicle renewal. Think of this practice as the bridge that carries you steadily into your May regrowth window.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Create your spot:</strong> Sit upright or lie down where you won’t be interrupted for 10 minutes. Dim the lights or close your eyes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anchor the breath:</strong> Inhale softly through the nose for a count of four, pause for one beat, then exhale through the mouth for six. Repeat 10 rounds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add awareness:</strong> On each exhale, imagine releasing tension from the scalp down through your shoulders and chest.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional deep reset:</strong> Once a week, try a 15‑minute yoga nidra or guided meditation before bed to deepen your resilience charge.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> easier focus during the day, a quicker settle at bedtime, and fewer “rushy” mornings within the first two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping practice on busy days—if that happens, do just two slow breaths before sleep to keep your streak alive.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each steady breath is a quiet message to your body: \"It’s safe to grow again.\" 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you spot when stress habits quietly drain your resilience, and guides you to swap them for behaviours that restore balance and confidence — the same calm your scalp needs to settle into healthy growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, you’ve handled a lot this year — illness, emotional strain, and injury — yet you’ve kept a beautifully steady routine. In this stabilization phase, your body is finally finding its rhythm again. This practice is your “big domino”: catching subtle self‑sabotage (like overthinking or skipping self‑care when tired) keeps your stress hormones quiet so follicles can stay anchored and prepare for that May regrowth window ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Catch the cue.</strong> Notice when you feel depleted or tempted to withdraw — that’s your moment to pause, not push.</li>\n<li><strong>Name the habit.</strong> Say it aloud: “I’m scrolling to numb out,” or “I’m skipping my walk.” Naming diffuses its hold.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap and soothe.</strong> Choose one grounding replacement — a 3‑minute breathing reset, gentle stretching, or writing one gratitude line.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a reset space.</strong> Keep a candle, notebook, or playlist ready in one spot so the healthy action is effortless to start.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect weekly.</strong> Every Sunday, jot a quick note: which swap felt easiest, which moment was hardest, and one small win you noticed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling steadier within minutes after a swap; sleeping more deeply; noticing fewer “wave days” of shedding by week two.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If your energy dips after long phone scrolls, set a 10‑minute limit and fire up your grounding cue instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — each mindful swap rewires calm into your day and steadiness into your scalp. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently guide your cycle back toward balance by tuning your daily rhythm, nutrition, and stress signals — empowering your body’s natural hormone harmony from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>You’re in the stabilization phase, Katelynn — that quiet rebuilding season after months of physical stress and an injury that taxed your system. Irregular yet often intense PMS signals that your hormones are still settling. This step is your “big domino”: when your hormones regain rhythm, shedding steadies and your roots get stronger ahead of the regrowth window in spring. Here’s where steady rituals start unlocking visible calm at your scalp and cycle alike.🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eat rhythmically:</strong> Aim for three balanced meals with steady protein (you already hit two — add one more snack or meal with 20–30 g protein to smooth hormonal swings).</li>\n<li><strong>Support cycle signals:</strong> Track your period length, PMS intensity, and energy dips for 2–3 months to spot progress and patterns.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance plate fats:</strong> Add an omega‑3 source (salmon, sardines, chia pudding, or algae oil) at least three times a week to support hormone cell membranes.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor wind-down:</strong> Keep your evening meditation ritual — predictable sleep timing reinforces hormonal cues of safety.</li>\n<li><strong>Gentle movement:</strong> Add 20–30 minutes of low‑intensity activity (walks, yoga) during luteal days when mood or bloating flare.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> PMS symptoms start softening; more stable mood across your cycle; shedding feels less “wave‑like” within two to three weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If meals slip toward low‑fat or skipped breakfasts, hormones can wobble again — prep quick protein‑rich breakfasts ahead to stay consistent.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds synchronization — every balanced plate and calm evening helps your body remember safety and grow again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Calming the Aftershocks So Your Roots Can Reset 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Katelynn, you’re in the stabilization phase — the most important bridge between shedding and regrowth. After months of recovery from your May injury with blood loss, your body is finally shifting out of “repair mode.” This week is about helping that shift stick by giving your system the calm consistency it needs to feel safe again.</p>\n  <p>Because your main triggers have resolved and your stress is now low, your biggest ally is steady rhythm — especially through sleep. Your survey shows you already sleep 9+ hours with nearly no night waking and no caffeine or alcohol. That’s a strong foundation. The practices this week — anchoring your sleep time, winding down gently, and optimizing your bedroom — magnify that stability by deepening restorative sleep, where cortisol drops and growth hormones rise to prepare follicles for regrowth.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets stress hormones:</strong> lowers lingering cortisol from months of recovery</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances repair signals:</strong> syncs your body clock so follicles exit shed mode together</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Boosts nightly recovery:</strong> enhances growth hormone pulses that build stronger new strands</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Protects your progress:</strong> consistent rest keeps future stress waves from reigniting shedding</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm, anchored night tells your body it’s safe to grow again — the quiet before your first baby hairs return 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
