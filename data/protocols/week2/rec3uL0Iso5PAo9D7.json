{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Mental Resilience Training is a simple daily practice of calming your mind through breathwork or guided relaxation, so stress stops running the show and your body shifts back toward balance.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has already peaked, but regrowth hasn’t started yet because ongoing stress is still keeping your system on edge. With high daily stress and only 5–6 hours of broken sleep, this practice becomes your “big domino.” By lowering pressure on your nervous system now, you’re opening the door for shedding to finally ease and baby hairs to begin emerging. This is the keystone to move you from holding steady into true recovery. 🌱</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Find a quiet spot before bed or first thing in the morning.</li>\n    <li>Sit or lie down comfortably; close your eyes.</li>\n    <li>Breathe in for a count of 4, hold for 2, exhale for 6 — repeat for 5–10 minutes.</li>\n    <li>If thoughts race, silently say “release” on each exhale to anchor your mind.</li>\n    <li>Optional: use a free guided yoga nidra or body-scan audio if you prefer structure.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, waking fewer times at night, or noticing your shoulders drop and jaw loosen during practice.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom scrolling can undo the calm you’ve built. Quick fix: place your phone in another room 30 minutes before bed and use that cue to begin your breathing session instead.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm breath at a time. You’ve already weathered the peak; this is how you give your body space to grow again. 💛</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently align your body’s natural rhythms so your hormones stop pulling against your hair cycle and start supporting steady growth again.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase: shedding has calmed from its peak but regrowth hasn’t yet started. Because your stress is still high and your cycles irregular at times, your hormones are likely adding friction. This practice is your “big domino” now—lowering that hormonal noise is what clears the path so your follicles can finally switch gears and sprout new baby hairs in the months ahead.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Anchor your meals:</strong> Aim for three balanced meals with steady protein (about a palm-sized portion) to prevent hormone-swing crashes.</li>\n    <li><strong>Light in the morning:</strong> Step outside for natural light within an hour of waking. This helps reset your circadian rhythm, stabilizing stress and reproductive hormones.</li>\n    <li><strong>Cycle check-in:</strong> Track your periods (apps or simple calendar notes) to spot irregularities and connect mood, sleep, and energy shifts more clearly.</li>\n    <li><strong>Lower evening noise:</strong> Since doom scrolling is your go-to, swap the last 15 minutes before bed for gentle stretching or reading—signals safety to your body, easing cortisol.</li>\n    <li><strong>Hydration cue:</strong> Keep a water bottle at your desk; dehydration strains hormone balance without you noticing.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling less wired at night, fewer mid-cycle mood swings, or waking with steadier energy within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-night phone scrolling spikes stress hormones—swap screen time with a calming cue (book or stretch) to avoid undoing bedtime progress.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—each small, steady choice tells your body it’s safe to heal, and that safety is exactly what your follicles need. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Professional Sleeper” is about stacking small, science-backed tweaks so your sleep works more like a power tool for recovery than a coin flip.

High stress plus only 5–6 hours of interrupted sleep is still keeping your body in “alarm mode.” Dialing up sleep quality is the single lever that calms stress hormones and creates the environment your scalp needs to move toward regrowth.
