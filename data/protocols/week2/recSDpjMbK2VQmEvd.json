It’s like pressing “reset” for your nervous system so your scalp and hormones can settle during this shedding wave.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jacque, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> — your shedding is still active, driven by high stress and a recent medication shift. This practice is your big domino because it teaches your body to switch off fight‑or‑flight each evening, lowering stress hormones that keep shedding cycles stuck. Building this calm now lays the ground for the stabilization months ahead and smoother regrowth come next summer.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose a 10‑minute window</strong> — ideally before bed when your phone is set aside.</li>\n  <li><strong>Find stillness</strong> — sit or lie down, one hand on your chest and one on your belly.</li>\n  <li><strong>Box breathe:</strong> inhale 4 seconds, hold 4, exhale 4, hold 4. Repeat for 10 rounds while softening your jaw and shoulders.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add a self‑check phrase:</strong> silently say “this wave will pass” on each exhale to anchor safety in your body.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stay present</strong> — when thoughts drift to shedding or stress, notice and return to the next breath. That single return is the training.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling warmth in hands or scalp after breathing, falling asleep faster, and fewer stress spikes during the day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If doom scrolling sneaks back in before bed, set a 9 p.m. phone‑off alarm or leave your phone to charge outside the room.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds resilience — one calm breath at a time, your body learns it’s safe again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently bring your hormones back into balance through daily choices—like how you eat, sleep, and calm your mind—so your hair can finally shift from shedding toward steady, sustainable regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase, and your hormones are under pressure from both chronic stress and a recent medication change. Those overlapping triggers can keep the shedding switch “on.” This practice is your big domino—stabilizing signals between stress hormones and female hormones, which helps your follicles move toward their stabilization stage by spring and primes regrowth by late summer. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> Include at least 25–30 g protein (eggs, tofu, Greek yogurt, or a shake) to stabilize cortisol and glucose early in the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor meals every 4–5 hours:</strong> No long fasts; aim for balanced plates with protein, colorful vegetables, and slow carbs to avoid hormone dips.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening calm reset:</strong> Ten minutes of slow breathing or gentle stretching before bed lowers nightly cortisol surges that interfere with repair.</li>\n<li><strong>Track two signals:</strong> Period regularity and energy upon waking—both are early markers of hormonal balance improving.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> (1) Fewer afternoon crashes or sugar cravings, (2) slightly steadier mood near your period, (3) a subtle lift in morning energy within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom‑scrolling before bed keeps stress hormones high. Quick fix—charge your phone outside your bedroom and swap 5 minutes of scrolling for deep breathing or journaling.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each balanced meal and calm evening gently restores your hormonal rhythm and sets your next stage of growth in motion. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you reclaim deep, restorative rest — the kind that steadies your hormones and quiets stress signals, so your scalp can move out of “survival mode” and back into “growth mode.”</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em>, meaning shedding waves are still active. Your high stress and irregular sleep window keep your system on alert. By improving sleep depth — not just hours — you reset your body’s nightly repair cycle, which is your biggest lever to calm stress-driven shedding before stabilization begins this spring. This is your “big domino.”</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Catch the first yawn.</strong> When you first feel drowsy, head to bed — don’t push past it. This simple cue aligns your body clock.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect the dark zone.</strong> Make your room as cave-like as possible: blackout curtains or an eye mask, and cover small light sources.</li>\n<li><strong>Cool it down.</strong> Set temperature between 60–67°F or crack a window 10 minutes before bed. Cooler air deepens slow-wave sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Morning reset.</strong> Get 5–10 minutes of natural light soon after waking. It anchors your circadian rhythm and helps your body produce melatonin at night.</li>\n<li><strong>Score your sleep depth.</strong> Each morning, note how refreshed you feel (0–10). Track it for a week — small gains mean your hormones are recalibrating.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, waking only once or less, and smoother morning energy within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-night doom scrolling — if your screen tempts you, charge your phone outside the bedroom and use a gentle alarm clock instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady night at a time, you’re teaching your body that safety and growth can coexist. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steadying Your Body While Shedding Peaks 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Jacque, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> — shedding may still feel unpredictable, but this is the body’s natural clearing cycle before stability returns. Because your <strong>medication change</strong> and ongoing emotional stress are still active, this week is about helping your system feel safe again. Stabilizing your sleep rhythm and calming your stress signals is what flips the body from “protect and shed” to “repair and rebuild.”</p>\n  <p>Right now, your 6–7 hours of lightly broken sleep and high daily stress keep cortisol gently elevated, which tells follicles to pause growth. The practices this week — setting a steady sleep anchor, winding down without screens, and creating a calm sleep space — work together to lower that internal alarm. When cortisol steadies, estrogen and thyroid signaling can rebalance, nutrients are directed back toward the scalp, and follicles begin to exit shed mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> lowers cortisol so hair cycles can normalize</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper rest:</strong> supports hormone repair and nutrient absorption overnight</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Body balance:</strong> stabilizes thyroid and estrogen rhythms affected by stress and meds</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Foundation for regrowth:</strong> prepares follicles for the stabilization window expected by spring–summer 2026</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep and calm your system, you shorten the peak and move closer to steady shedding and the first signs of new growth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
