This simple daily reset is your big domino: it steadies your stress response so those new baby hairs can keep growing stronger toward your regrowth window this spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set aside 5 minutes</strong> each morning or evening when you won’t be interrupted — before your first coffee or right after the baby’s bedtime both work beautifully.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor your breath:</strong> close your eyes, inhale slowly through the nose for four counts, hold two, exhale through the mouth for six. Feel your shoulders drop with each breath.</li>\n<li><strong>Add gentle focus:</strong> as you breathe, silently repeat “I’m safe, I’m restoring.” Let thoughts drift — no need to push them away.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional upgrade:</strong> once a week, play a short yoga nidra or guided relaxation before sleep for a deeper full-body reset.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> easier winding down at night, fewer stress spikes during the day, and feeling more patient with your body’s pace within a week or two.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breath time on busy days — set a phone reminder or link it to something you already do (like making tea) so it becomes automatic.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds calm from the inside out — each steady breath tells your body, “it’s safe to grow.” 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps your body find balance again after major shifts — particularly those brought by pregnancy. It focuses on gentle, natural ways to support your hormones so shedding settles, and new growth takes hold faster.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re in your stabilization phase — shedding has eased and baby hairs are already sprouting. Postpartum hormone levels are still finding their rhythm after August’s birth, and this practice is your “big domino.” It steadies those fluctuations so your follicles stay nourished and move confidently toward regrowth through spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor your nourishment:</strong> Include one iron + protein-rich meal daily — think lentils with spinach or eggs with beans. This fuels healthy hormone recycling.</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance blood sugar gently:</strong> Pair each meal with some protein or healthy fat to avoid blood sugar dips that can disturb hormonal balance.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build mini stress buffers:</strong> Once or twice a day, pause for three deep belly breaths — it’s tiny but powerfully signals safety to your hormonal axis.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep evenings calm:</strong> Dim lights an hour before bed to encourage melatonin release — this hormone quietly supports postpartum rebalancing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track your cycle cues:</strong> Jot down flow length, mood, and energy. These notes tell us when stability is returning!</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable periods, fewer sudden mood dips, and improved morning energy within 2 weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast can spike cortisol and slow hormone recovery. Quick fix — keep ready-to-go protein options (like Greek yogurt or boiled eggs).</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced meal, one calm breath, one week at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you master small environmental and timing tweaks that let your body sink into deeper, more restorative sleep cycles — the kind that balances hormones and fuels steady hair regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re in the stabilization phase — your shedding is calming and those baby hairs are proof. Right now, quality sleep is what locks this progress in. After months of postpartum hormonal flux, becoming a “professional sleeper” is your big domino: it steadies cortisol, supports healthy estrogen balance, and helps your follicles stay in growth mode through spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Light first, dark later:</strong> Get real daylight within 30 minutes of waking — even brief balcony light cues your brain to anchor your circadian rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature check:</strong> Keep your bedroom around 18–20 °C; cooler air tells your body it’s time to slow down and deepen sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Device curfew:</strong> Dim screens or use night mode at least an hour before bed to prevent blue light from delaying your natural melatonin release.</li>\n<li><strong>Pre‑sleep signal:</strong> Five minutes before lights out, do the same tiny ritual nightly — maybe stretching your shoulders or taking three slow breaths — to condition your brain that it’s rest time.</li>\n<li><strong>Morning consistency:</strong> Wake within the same 45‑minute window daily (your average already is!) to reinforce that internal timing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll start waking more alert; evening yawns arrive right on cue; deeper, dream‑filled sleep leaves your scalp less “tense.”</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If scrolling slips in again late at night, use airplane mode by 9 p.m. — your nervous system needs that quiet signal.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — protect this nightly rhythm and your body will use every good hour of rest to rebuild strength from the root up. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steadying Your Body After the Postpartum Storm 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Simona, you’re now in the stabilization phase — that gentle turning point where shedding eases and baby hairs begin to peek through.
