Mental Resilience Training is your “big domino”: it trains your nervous system to downshift daily, turning off the very signal that keeps stress-related shedding cycling. Each calm minute today helps your follicles feel safe to regrow in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your space:</strong> Sit or lie somewhere you won’t be interrupted. Silence notifications and dim the light.</li>\n<li><strong>Breathe in 4–hold 2–out 6:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale slowly through your mouth for 6. Repeat 8 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Body scan (2 min):</strong> Move your attention from your scalp down to your toes, noticing sensations without judgment. Let each exhale release tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Finish with a calming statement:</strong> Silently repeat, “My body is healing; my hair is safe to grow.”</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor it:</strong> Practice at the same time daily—morning before screens or evening before bed works beautifully.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> A lighter jaw and shoulder feel by day three; steadier energy midafternoon; fewer stress spikes when things go wrong.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If you notice late-night phone scrolling eating the time you meant for this, set your alarm 5 minutes earlier and breathe before touching screens.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one calm breath at a time, your follicles get the message that safety has returned. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you pause when stress tempts you toward old habits, and replace those choices with small, nourishing ones that lower tension instead of feeding it. It’s about creating mini reset moments so your body can stay in “repair” mode — the state where growth happens.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Meghan, you’re in your stabilization phase — baby hairs are appearing, but ongoing stress is still whispering to your system. Because stress has been your main trigger since last year and emotional eating is how you often cope, this swap is your big domino. Each time you interrupt that pattern, you signal safety to your body, which lets shedding calm and regrowth speed up toward your spring window.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Spot the urge:</strong> When you feel that “I just need something” moment, name it out loud — “This is stress talking.”</li>\n<li><strong>Pause 90 seconds:</strong> Step away from your phone or kitchen; breathe slow and deep into your belly for a full minute and a half.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap in a soothe:</strong> Choose a nourishing action — short walk, stretch, journaling one worry, or making a cup of herbal tea.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect quickly:</strong> Ask, “Did I need comfort or fuel?” If it’s fuel, eat a balanced snack; if comfort, repeat your soothe.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your wins:</strong> Jot a checkmark or heart in your notes every time you interrupt the old pattern. Momentum builds fast.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling calmer within minutes of your new swap, fewer late‑night cravings, and steadier mood through the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Scrolling when anxious can reignite the stress loop. Quick fix — place your phone in another room during your pause window.</li>\n<li>Consistency compounds, Meghan — each mindful swap tells your body, “We’re safe now,” and that’s when your hair truly starts to thrive. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance your body’s key messengers — the hormones that decide how your hair grows, sheds, and recovers — through small daily habits that signal safety and stability to your system.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, Meghan, you’re in the stabilization phase: shedding is still unpredictable, but new baby hairs mean your follicles are listening again. Because chronic stress has been active for over a year and you’ve noticed mild hormonal signs like adult acne, this step is your big domino. Bringing your hormones back into rhythm lowers stress signals and helps your new growth survive the fragile regrowth window ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Start each day with steady fuel:</strong> Within 30–45 minutes of waking, eat a protein‑rich breakfast (around 25–30 g); this anchors your cortisol and blood sugar early.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build a midday hormone pause:</strong> Step outside or stretch for 2–3 deep‑breathing minutes before lunch. Natural light exposure steadies your circadian cues.</li>\n  <li><strong>Evening wind‑down:</strong> Dim lights an hour before bed and unplug from screens; consistent bedtimes train your hormone rhythm more effectively than any supplement.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track your gentle patterns:</strong> Note energy dip times, PMS changes, or acne flares for two cycles; this helps you and me fine‑tune nutrition or stress work if needed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Mood feels more even across your cycle, fewer mid‑afternoon crashes, and calmer skin within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating after stressful days can spike insulin and undo the stability you’re building — try planning a high‑protein snack before cravings hit.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your Body After the Storm 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Meghan, you’re in the stabilization phase — that gentle turning point when shedding starts to settle and your baby hairs hint that recovery has begun. Because your main trigger, chronic stress from Sept 2024, is still active, this week’s focus on rest and rhythm is the “big domino” that helps your body recognize safety again. The injury you healed from last fall added strain, but now your system is ready to steady itself.</p>\n  <p>These practices — anchoring your bedtime, winding down properly, and optimizing your sleep space — calm the stress loop that keeps follicles uneasy. Deep, predictable sleep lowers cortisol, restores thyroid and sex‑hormone balance, and boosts growth hormone release that repairs follicle cells overnight. With your 7–8 hours of sleep but 2–3 night wakings, shoring up continuity is what flips your body from survival to restoration mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> steadier cortisol patterns signal follicles it’s safe to grow again</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> balanced melatonin and thyroid rhythms support thicker strands</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Cell repair:</strong> deeper sleep releases growth hormone to rebuild follicle structure</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Sleep efficiency:</strong> fewer night wakings mean longer repair cycles for scalp and skin</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm evening routine you complete tells your body, “the danger has passed” — and every restful night moves you closer to calmer shedding and visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
