{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">  \n<div class=\"big-domino\">  \n<p>Toby, your shedding peaked months ago and is now stable—this means you’re standing right at the edge of regrowth. But chronic stress and rumination are still ongoing, and that pressure keeps cortisol elevated, slowing the full shift into the “regrowth start” phase.

The biggest barrier holding you from sliding into regrowth is not biology—it’s the stress spiral. You told me you reach for alcohol when stress spikes, but because drinking isn’t actually part of your weekly pattern anymore, that “go‑to” coping strategy leaves you hanging with nothing reliable in its place. This practice gives you a healthier swap anytime stress threatens to push cortisol back up, so you can keep shedding steady and move into the regrowth window faster. 🌱</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Pick one simple coping swap (walk, journaling, 4‑7‑8 breathing, quick stretch) and make it your default.</li> \n<li>Create a “pause cue”—when stress rises, commit to 2 minutes with your swap before any old habit kicks in.</li> \n<li>Use your evening wind‑down (already in Week 1) as your anchor to reset stress daily.</li> \n<li>Track how often you swapped successfully; aim for 3+ times weekly to start.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Morning: 5 minutes light or breathwork before caffeine (buffer cortisol curve).</li> \n<li>Daytime: Keep a “swap card” on your phone lockscreen with your top 2 alternatives.</li> \n<li>Evening: Pair your swap with shutting down screens 30 min before bed.</li> \n<li>Weekly: Reflect on one stress moment where you handled it better than last month—note progress.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>List stress cues that trigger rumination (late emails, conflict thoughts, etc.).</li> \n<li>Choose 1–2 swaps you actually like—no heroic choices needed.</li> \n<li>Place reminders: sticky note on laptop, “swap card” on phone, even an alarm titled “pause.”</li> \n<li>Next time stress peaks, hit the pause cue → try your swap for 2 minutes.</li> \n<li>Celebrate—even partial replacement reduces cortisol surge and helps hair stabilize.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your stress is ongoing; swap techniques flatten cortisol spikes that otherwise keep hairs in telogen, slowing regrowth.</li> \n<li>Because your shedding peaked months after illness and workouts, stress is now the main ongoing driver—this practice keeps stabilization steady and shortens lag to visible regrowth.</li> \n<li>Lowering rumination also improves sleep quality; better deep sleep signals follicle repair overnight.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If you slip back to using alcohol regularly to “cope,” pause and re‑anchor with swaps; drinking late undoes sleep and hair progress.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 7–10 days, you feel fewer “stress hangovers,” easier wind‑downs, and maybe even a steadier mood around PMS days.</li> \n<li>And remember ❤️—even one successful swap per day is a win that helps move you from stable shedding toward fresh baby hairs again.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Toby, your shedding has already peaked and is now stable, which means you’re in the “stabilization” window.
