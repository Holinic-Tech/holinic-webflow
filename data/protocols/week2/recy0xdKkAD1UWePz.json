You’re in the <em>peak</em> phase: shedding feels intense, yet new baby hairs show recovery is underway. This practice is your “big domino” because calming your stress response turns off the signal that keeps follicles in shock. Each time you slow your breath, you move closer to stabilization and the quiet growth waiting beyond spring. 🌱</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set your moment:</strong> Choose one calm pocket—morning before the day begins or evening before bed—where you can be undisturbed for 7 minutes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anchor with breath:</strong> Sit comfortably, inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 2, exhale slowly through your mouth for 6. Notice your belly soften.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cycle for presence:</strong> Repeat for five rounds, letting each exhale feel longer and quieter. If thoughts rush in, simply return to counting.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add gentle release:</strong> After breathing, stretch your shoulders up and back, or lie down for two minutes in stillness to absorb the calm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice your heart rate easing quicker after stressful moments, fewer tension headaches, and a clearer sense of control across the day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> On hectic evenings you might skip your pause and jump straight into screens—set a reminder alarm or pair this routine with brushing your teeth to lock it in.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—one steady breath at a time, your hair and nervous system both learn it’s safe to grow again. 💛</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance your internal rhythms—so your stress, energy, and hair growth signals can re-sync without complicated tests or medications.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Shivani, you’re in the peak phase—when shedding surges from stress that began in September. Your cycles are regular and stable, so your hormones aren’t the enemy; it’s how stress has unsettled their natural flow. This practice is your big domino because once your body feels emotionally safe again, your follicles shift from “protect” mode into “grow” mode, setting the stage for stabilization by spring. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Take a 2-minute pause each morning.</strong> Before screens or messages, place a hand on your heart, take three slow breaths, and mentally thank your body for healing. This resets your morning stress chemistry.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor your meals.</strong> Eat roughly at the same times daily—especially breakfast with protein and natural fats. This steadiness cues balanced cortisol and insulin, two quiet hormone helpers for strong growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Light exposure reset.</strong> Step into daylight within 30 minutes of waking for at least 5 minutes. It signals your brain to regulate melatonin and reproductive hormones naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Gentle unwind ritual.</strong> Each evening, stretch shoulders and neck or journal one small win from the day before bed. It nudges your nervous system into repair mode overnight.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling calmer mornings, fewer stress spikes mid‑day, warmer hands or feet, and steadier energy through the afternoon.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast when stress runs high—this can amplify cortisol swings. Quick fix: prep a simple high‑protein option the night before.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each small act tells your body it’s safe to grow again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you train your body to sleep like a pro — not longer, but deeper — so you wake up recharged and your scalp stays in its natural repair rhythm.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> of stress-linked shedding. Your sleep is regular, but high stress means your body still needs nightly recovery cues. Mastering “professional” sleep depth this week is your big domino — it calms the overactive stress response that kicked off shedding in September and helps move you steadily toward stabilization in early spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Morning light rule:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, step outside for 5–10 minutes. Natural light locks your body clock so your easy rhythm at night strengthens automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature drop cue:</strong> Two hours before bed, turn the room slightly cooler or take a warm shower that lets your core temperature fall afterward — it signals “time to repair.”</li>\n<li><strong>Pre‑sleep cutoff:</strong> Dim overhead lighting and screens one hour before bed; keep small lamps or night mode only.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind–body handoff:</strong> Once in bed, breathe slowly for one minute — in for 4, out for 6. It’s enough to tell your system, “The day is done.”</li>\n<li><strong>Protect the wake window:</strong> If you wake once at night (which you said happens occasionally), stay calm, limit clock‑checking, and focus on slow exhales. You’ll drift back faster.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up before your alarm, steadier mood through the afternoon, and fewer cortisol “rush” moments by mid‑day.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> On tense evenings, your mind may replay stressful events — when that happens, jot the thought down, turn off the light, and remind yourself you’ll handle it in the morning.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — each solid night tells your follicles, “safe to grow again.” 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Creating Calm in the Middle of the Peak 🌾</h4>\n  <p>Shivani, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em>—the moment when shedding feels most visible, yet your new baby hairs show that recovery has already begun. Because your main trigger is ongoing emotional stress from September, this week is about giving your body clear signals of safety. The more consistently you calm your system now, the faster your follicles can shift out of “alert” mode and into repair.</p>\n  <p>Your sleep rhythm is already strong—7–8 hours with steady bedtimes—so this week we’ll turn that into your anchor. The practices ahead (your sleep anchor, wind-down stack, and bedroom reset) work together to lower cortisol and quiet the stress chemistry that keeps shedding active. When cortisol steadies, circulation improves, nutrients reach the roots more easily, and the growth phase stays switched on longer.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets stress signals:</strong> lowers cortisol spikes from ongoing emotional strain</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Restores hormonal rhythm:</strong> aligns melatonin and growth hormone release overnight</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Protects active follicles:</strong> prevents new hairs from being pushed into shed mode</li>\n    <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Improves nutrient delivery:</strong> better blood flow brings oxygen and iron to the scalp</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm evening you create tells your body it’s safe again—and every restful night moves you closer to steadier shedding and visible fullness ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
