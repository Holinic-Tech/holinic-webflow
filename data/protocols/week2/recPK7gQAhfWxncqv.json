Because your main driver seems to be a slow nutritional or mild hormonal imbalance, building mental calm each day helps regulate those same systems. This practice is your big domino: lower background stress, better hormone rhythm, faster path toward visible regrowth in early 2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a daily window:</strong> Choose one consistent time (morning or pre‑sleep) to spend five quiet minutes focusing on slow breathing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Try the 4‑7‑8 method:</strong> Inhale through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 7, exhale softly for 8. Repeat four rounds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add a body check:</strong> While breathing, mentally scan from crown to toes and release any tension—especially jaw and shoulders.</li>\n  <li><strong>Once a week:</strong> Experiment with a 10‑minute yoga nidra or guided meditation to deepen the reset.</li>\n  <li><strong>Note your calm cues:</strong> Track how fast your breath slows and your chest feels lighter after each session.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable morning mood, easier focus, or fewer mid‑day energy dips within the first week.</li>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Your scalp may feel warmer or tingling lightly after sessions—a sign of improved blood flow.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you skip sessions when work stress spikes (a common trap with “moderate” stress levels), set a 5‑minute phone reminder and gently pause no matter what’s happening.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds resilience—one grounded breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance the subtle rhythm between your stress, thyroid, and female hormones, so your follicles can shift from “holding pattern” back into active growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, your shedding peaked and has steadied, which means your scalp is ready to rebuild—but your follicles still need a clear hormonal signal to restart growth. Because your cycles are a bit spotty and iron was once low, this is your big domino: steadying hormones now helps your next phase—visible regrowth—arrive faster and stronger.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Track your cycle cues:</strong> Note day 1 of your period and any PMS changes or spotting in a journal—this helps you see patterns of improvement within weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat every 4–5 hours:</strong> Include some protein and healthy fat at each meal to keep blood sugar and hormone signals steady.</li>\n<li><strong>Support iron naturally:</strong> Pair iron-rich foods (like lentils, eggs, or red meat) with vitamin‑C sources to help absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Calm daily cortisol:</strong> Set a 5‑minute wind‑down after work—slow walk, gentle breathing, or journaling—to keep stress hormones from crowding estrogen balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Recheck over time:</strong> After 6–8 weeks, review your notes for cycle regularity and energy; these are quiet signals of rebalancing beneath the surface.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Slightly shorter spotting phase, fewer PMS swings, steadier energy in the late afternoon, or calmer sleep within 7–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals or long caffeine fasts can spike stress hormones—if that happens, try a small protein snack mid‑morning.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one balanced meal and calm breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you train your body to deliver deeper, more restorative sleep naturally—so your hormonal and growth signals flow consistently overnight, fueling stronger strands from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, you’re in the stabilization phase: shedding has steadied, but new growth still needs a clear internal rhythm to re‑ignite. Because your main driver seems nutritional or mild hormonal imbalance, anchoring high‑quality sleep is your “big domino.” It gently steadies cortisol and supports iron and protein uptake—bridging you from stability toward visible regrowth by early 2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Expose your eyes to morning light.</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, get 5–10 minutes of outdoor daylight. This resets your circadian clock and deepens night‑time sleep pressure.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep a fixed wake‑up target.</strong> Choose a wake time you can maintain within 15 minutes every day—even weekends. Bedtime can slide a bit; waking consistency anchors your rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Move daily, but finish workouts 3+ hours before bed.</strong> Moderate activity earlier in the day improves slow‑wave sleep and circulatory delivery to the scalp.</li>\n<li><strong>Dim cues after sundown.</strong> Reduce overhead lighting and use warm light to signal “night mode.”</li>\n<li><strong>Track energy, not hours.</strong> Each morning, rate 1‑5 how refreshed you feel. Adjust light and movement until most mornings land at 4 or 5.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep within 15 minutes, wake up before your alarm, and notice steadier energy or fewer midday slumps within 10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Scrolling in bed—blue‑light exposure delays melatonin. Quick fix: park your phone to charge across the room 30 minutes before lights‑out.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each strong night whispers to your follicles, “it’s safe to grow again.” 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Building the Foundation So Regrowth Can Begin 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Eeva, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has finally steadied after its mid‑2024 peak, but your follicles still need the right signals to restart growth. Because your main trigger is an ongoing nutritional and mild hormonal imbalance, this week is about calming the system that tells your body it’s safe to shift from “maintenance” to “repair.”</p>\n  <p>Your sleep is fairly regular, which is a great base. By anchoring bedtime within that 30–60‑minute window and deepening rest through the <em>Sleep Anchor</em> and <em>Wind‑Down Stack</em> practices, you’ll strengthen the nightly rhythm that governs cortisol and growth hormones. These quiet hours are when follicle stem cells reset and prepare for new growth — especially important before your forecasted regrowth window around early 2025.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol balance:</strong> steady sleep cues lower stress hormones that block nutrient use in follicles</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal alignment:</strong> consistent rest supports thyroid and estrogen balance that drive healthy growth cycles</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Cell recovery:</strong> deep sleep activates repair proteins and nutrient delivery to dormant roots</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Energy stability:</strong> better rest helps you absorb iron and protein more efficiently throughout the day</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm evening you create this week strengthens the signal for your body to move from holding onto stress to rebuilding strength — the quiet start of visible regrowth ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
