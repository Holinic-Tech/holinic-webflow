In this stabilization phase, stress calmness is the single domino that lets shedding settle sooner and speeds your return to regrowth. These few minutes of grounded stillness each day tell your body, “we’re safe,” allowing your scalp’s renewal cycle to resume its rhythm.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose your pocket of peace:</strong> Morning before opening your phone, or evening before bed. Just five minutes is enough to start.</li>\n  <li><strong>Ground your body:</strong> Sit or lie comfortably, feel your feet or back supported, and release your shoulders.</li>\n  <li><strong>Practice paced breathing:</strong> Inhale gently through the nose for 4 counts, pause 1 beat, exhale through the mouth for 6 counts. Repeat for 10 rounds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anchor the calm:</strong> As you breathe, silently say “ease in / release out.” This anchors safety in your nervous system.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Once a week, try a 10‑minute yoga nidra or guided body scan to deepen the reset.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You notice your heart rate easing faster after stress, your jaw or brow feel softer, and your sleep stretches longer without waking.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom scrolling before bed will spike cortisol again. Quick fix: park your phone outside your room 30 minutes before wind down.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm breath at a time, Marin. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you gently rebalance your body’s internal rhythm — the quiet signals between stress, sleep, and nutrition that decide how steady your hair cycle feels.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Because you’re in the stabilization phase after months of stress and a recent medication change, your hormones are still finding their new equilibrium. This is your “big domino”: steadying these signals now helps shedding calm and prepares your scalp for the regrowth window starting around June 2025. It’s about resetting your base before growth truly accelerates. 💫</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Morning protein anchor:</strong> Aim for at least 30 g of protein at breakfast — eggs, Greek yogurt, or a smoothie with protein powder. This steadies blood sugar and hormone release for the rest of the day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cycle-friendly movement:</strong> Do moderate exercise (like brisk walking or yoga) four days a week. It subtly balances cortisol and supports estrogen/progesterone harmony.</li>\n  <li><strong>Evening calm cue:</strong> 30 minutes before bed, dim lights and unplug — swap doom scrolling for breathing or journaling to help lower nighttime stress hormones.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add omega fats:</strong> Include fatty fish or algae oil twice a week to supply healthy fats your hormones need to regulate themselves smoothly.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hydration check‑in:</strong> Keep water intake consistent, especially on alcohol nights, to prevent hormonal dehydration dips that affect scalp circulation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy across the day, calmer pre‑period moods, and a more predictable shedding rhythm within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night phone scrolls can spike cortisol right before sleep — try setting “airplane mode” at lights‑out as a quick reset.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — your hormones love rhythm, and so do your follicles. Keep going, Marin. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about upgrading the quality of every hour you spend asleep — making those 7–8 hours feel like a true nightly reset for your body, hormones, and scalp.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marin, you’re in your stabilization phase, which means your follicles are ready to quiet the chaos caused by the medication change last year. Strengthening deep sleep is your “big domino” right now — it helps balance stress signals and steadies hormones, allowing shedding to taper so regrowth can begin by early summer. This is how you help your body feel safe enough to restart growth from the inside out.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor light early.</strong> Step outside within 30–60 minutes of waking for at least 5 minutes. Natural light cues your circadian rhythm and boosts morning alertness.</li>\n<li><strong>Dim and wind down 90 minutes before bed.</strong> Lower overhead lights and shift screens to night mode or use warm lamps — this lets melatonin rise naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Cool your sleep cave.</strong> Keep your room between 17–19°C and consider breathable bedding. A cooler body core helps you drift into restorative stages faster.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect consistency.</strong> Even if bedtime varies, aim to wake within a 30‑minute window daily to strengthen your rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect on your energy next morning.</strong> Briefly note how quickly you fell asleep and how refreshed you feel — awareness breeds progress.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep within 15–20 minutes, quieter mind at bedtime, and feeling noticeably steadier by mid‑morning.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Doom scrolling before lights out (your go‑to stress escape) will jolt your mind awake again — keep your phone charging outside the bedroom or set “Do Not Disturb.”</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm, high‑quality night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Steady the Ground Beneath Your Follicles 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Marin, you’re in the stabilization phase — the shedding storms have already peaked, and your body is learning to find its rhythm again. Because your medication change from last August is still influencing your system, this week is all about helping your body feel safe and steady so your follicles can shift from “protect and shed” mode into “repair and recover.”</p>\n  <p>These practices — anchoring your sleep, winding down before bed, and pausing alcohol — directly calm cortisol and rebalance your nightly hormones. Even though you sleep 7–8 hours, your variable bedtime and a few drinks in the week can still nudge stress hormones higher and blunt the deep-sleep cycles where hair-regrowth signals happen. By locking in a consistent wind-down, you give your scalp the message that the environment is stable again.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythms:</strong> lowers stress signals that keep follicles in a holding pattern</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Improves hormone balance:</strong> steadier sleep and less alcohol help normalize estrogen‑cortisol interplay</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Boosts restorative sleep:</strong> deeper stages release growth hormone for follicle repair</li>\n    <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Restores stress resilience:</strong> calmer nights make daytime stress less likely to trigger shedding</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your bedtime routine, you’re teaching your body that it’s safe to regrow — one calm evening at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
