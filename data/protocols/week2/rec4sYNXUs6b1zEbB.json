Yet ongoing chronic stress and hormonal treatment can quietly keep stress hormones elevated. This training is your “big domino”: by calming your nervous system for a few minutes daily, you help protect new growth and move fully into the regrowth phase with steadier roots and smoother strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Find five quiet minutes.</strong> Sit or lie down, close your eyes, place one hand on your abdomen.</li>\n<li><strong>Use 4‑7‑8 breathing:</strong> Inhale gently for 4 seconds, hold for 7, exhale through your mouth for 8. Repeat 5 cycles.</li>\n<li><strong>Shift awareness to your scalp.</strong> Imagine warmth and calm travelling from your breath into each follicle.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor the calm.</strong> When finished, note one word describing how you feel—carry it into the rest of your day.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional wind‑down add‑on:</strong> Do one short yoga‑nidra or guided body scan before bed twice this week.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You may notice your shoulders dropping more easily, deeper sleep, or fewer stressful spikes during your day within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If late‑day caffeine creeps back in, it can blunt the calm response—swap it for herbal tea after 3 p.m.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each calm breath teaches your body it’s safe to regrow. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you spot small daily choices that quietly drain your energy and replace them with habits that actually refill your tank. It’s about creating calm from the inside out—so your body feels safe to keep growing strong hair.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Solveig, you’re moving into the regrowth start phase—shedding is steady and new baby hairs are sprouting. The big domino now is protecting that progress by calming long‑term stress. Since you manage pressure mainly through exercise, this practice adds a gentler layer that steadies hormones and gives each new strand a stronger start.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pause awareness:</strong> For the next three days, notice any pattern that leaves you tense afterward—mental replaying of work issues, rushing meals, or over‑exercising when you’re already tired.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap strategy:</strong> Choose one of those moments and replace it with a 5‑minute calming cue—slow breathing with shoulders down, a short walk outdoors, or jotting a single gratitude line.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor it:</strong> Pair your new cue with a fixed daily event (e.g., right after finishing lunch or before brushing your teeth) so it sticks automatically.</li>\n<li><strong>Review weekly:</strong> Each Sunday, ask: “Which habit left me calmer?” Keep that, drop what didn’t, and add one more supportive swap.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More even energy across the day, deeper evening relaxation, and less scalp tightness—often within one to two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Over‑training when stressed can spike cortisol again. If workouts feel forced, trade one session for stretching or a walk to let recovery catch up.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one small self‑kind decision at a time, and your new hairs will thank you for the calm. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you bring your stress and sex hormones back into balance through small, consistent actions that gently recalibrate your body’s signals. It’s about giving your hair and body the steady environment they need to keep growing stronger.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>You’re in the regrowth start phase, Solveig — shedding has steadied, and those new baby hairs prove your follicles are listening. Because you’ve had long-term hormonal treatment and ongoing stress since 2013, regulating these signals now is your big domino. A calmer endocrine rhythm will lock in the stability you’ve earned and speed your shift into strong, visible regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Ground your mornings:</strong> Wake and expose your eyes to natural light within 30 minutes of rising — it anchors your cortisol rhythm and steadies hormones.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add breakfast protein:</strong> Aim for ~30 g of protein within an hour of waking. This fuels thyroid and estrogen metabolism while stabilizing energy for the day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Create a 2‑hour no‑caffeine window before hormonetaking:</strong> If you take hormonal medication or supplements, give your system clean absorption time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Evening decompression:</strong> A 10‑minute pre‑bed wind‑down (stretching, reading, or journaling) quietly lowers stress hormones that interfere with repair.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track sensations:</strong> Once a week, note mood, sleep quality, and scalp comfort — these are subtle but reliable hormone‑balance signals.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier daily energy, less scalp tingling, and feeling calmer before bed — all signs hormones are syncing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping protein through the morning leaves hormones chasing blood sugar spikes. Quick fix — prep a smoothie or boiled eggs the night before.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum, Solveig — each balanced day adds strength to those baby hairs you’re already seeing. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re-establishing Calm So Your New Growth Can Take Root 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Solveig, you’re in the <em>regrowth start</em> phase — shedding has steadied, and those new baby hairs you’ve noticed mean your follicles are waking up again. Because your main trigger, chronic stress, is still active through work and life load, this week is about stabilizing your internal rhythm so those fragile new hairs can stay anchored and thicken.</p>\n  <p>These first practices — setting a firm sleep anchor, unwinding before bed, and optimizing your bedroom — are simple but powerful. Deep, consistent sleep lowers cortisol, balances estrogen and thyroid signals, and gives follicles the nightly recovery window they need. With your fairly regular 7–8 hours of rest and only occasional night wakings, tightening that rhythm by even 30 minutes can flip your stress chemistry from “protect mode” to “repair mode.”</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower cortisol peaks:</strong> keeps stress hormones from nudging follicles back into shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> steadier sleep-wake cycles support balanced estrogen and thyroid activity</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle repair time:</strong> deep sleep triggers growth hormone release to rebuild strand strength</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Restorative calm:</strong> creates the inner safety signal your body needs to keep new growth anchored</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your wind‑down and anchor your bedtime, you’re telling your body it’s safe to regrow — and those tiny hairs will thank you for it 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
