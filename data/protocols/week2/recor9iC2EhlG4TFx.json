Because chronic stress was your main shedding trigger, strengthening your mind–body calm is the big domino that moves you toward regrowth. These few minutes of focus each day help your system stop over‑producing stress signals and let new hairs begin their quiet return by early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a 10‑minute calm block:</strong> Pick one consistent time — right after your workout or before bed — where you won’t be interrupted.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor with breath:</strong> Inhale gently through your nose for 4 counts, hold for 1, exhale through your mouth for 6. Do this for 3 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Body release scan:</strong> Bring attention from toes to head, relaxing each area. Notice tight spots (jaw, shoulders) and soften them on each exhale.</li>\n<li><strong>Optional bonus:</strong> Once a week, try a short guided yoga nidra or calming music track to extend the relaxation window.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Slightly fewer night awakenings; less “racing mind” when winding down; scalp tension easing as you brush or wash.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑afternoon caffeine can blunt the calm effect. If you crave a boost after 2 pm, swap coffee for water or gentle stretching.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one centered breath at a time, your hair will feel that safety too. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you catch the quiet, stress‑driven habits that keep your body on high alert and your hair stuck in a shedding mode—then replace them with choices that calm your system and steady growth signals.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Devy, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding is easing, but high stress is still echoing through your body. Because exercise is how you usually cope (a great start!), this practice is your big domino: it keeps stress relief working <em>for</em> your recovery, not against it.

Because your main trigger, chronic stress, is still ongoing, this week is all about sending your body the signal that it’s safe to slow shedding. The worst months likely passed around late 2025, and the calmer, steadier routines you build now set the stage for regrowth in early 2026.</p>\n  <p>With your 6–7 hours of sleep and 2–3 night wakings, your nervous system hasn’t been getting full repair time. The practices this week — anchoring your sleep, winding down before bed, and optimizing your bedroom — are the “big domino.” They directly lower cortisol and restore the nightly hormone rhythm that tells follicles to pause shedding. Once cortisol drops, nutrients and oxygen flow more freely to the scalp, allowing resting follicles to reset.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer stress loop:</strong> steady sleep cues reduce the cortisol spikes that trigger shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> consistent bedtimes balance melatonin and growth signals</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper rest:</strong> more time in deep sleep repairs tissue and energizes follicles</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Foundation for regrowth:</strong> prepares the scalp environment for baby hairs to emerge in the next phase</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your wind‑down and rest fully, you teach your body that safety has returned — and your hair will soon follow that cue 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
