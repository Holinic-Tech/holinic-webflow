This practice is your “big domino” because lowering stress hormones directly steadies shedding patterns and supports the transition toward stabilization by mid‑2025. When your mind feels grounded, your follicles interpret safety—and begin to recover.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your moment:</strong> Set aside 7 minutes before bed or first thing in the morning—same time daily if possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor your breath:</strong> Sit or lie down. Inhale gently through your nose for a count of 4, hold 1, exhale slowly through your mouth for 6. Repeat for 10 rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Body scan reset:</strong> Starting at your scalp, notice tension traveling down through your neck, shoulders, and chest. Exhale any tightness out.</li>\n<li><strong>Close with an intention:</strong> Whisper something steady, like “My body is recalibrating; each breath teaches safety.” Let that be your nightly cue to relax.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable mood before bedtime, fewer mid‑night awakenings, and a clear sense of calm that lingers into your morning routine.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If late‑day caffeine or alcohol (over three nights a week) slips back in, your nervous system will stay alert. Choose herbal tea or sparkling water after 3 pm—your sleep cycle will thank you.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one centered breath at a time, Mimi. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you notice when stress pushes you toward habits that quietly drain your energy — like emotional eating or an extra glass of wine — and replace them with small actions that calm your body instead of spiking it.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Mimi, you’re in the peak phase — shedding still feels active, and hormone shifts from perimenopause layer extra strain onto sleep and nutrition. This practice is your big domino because every time stress leads to sugar or alcohol for comfort, your blood sugar and hormones swing harder. Swapping these moments resets balance and gently moves you toward stabilization by mid‑2025.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Catch the cue:</strong> When you feel that urge to snack or pour a drink after stress, pause long enough to name what you’re feeling — even just, “I’m tense right now.”</li>\n    <li><strong>Sub in a steadying ritual:</strong> Keep a 3‑minute fix ready — a short walk, cold water sip, or deep‑belly breathing until your shoulders drop.</li>\n    <li><strong>Close the loop gently:</strong> If you still want something comforting, choose protein‑rich or whole‑food snack options to help hormones stay steady overnight.</li>\n    <li><strong>Reflect once a day:</strong> Jot one line at bedtime: “Which moment did I choose calm over craving?” It builds awareness quickly.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer late‑night snacks, less bloating on waking, and a calmer mood at bedtime within 10 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late caffeine plus emotional eating can collide; place a mental fence after 3 pm and pair the craving with a walk instead.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm choice at a time, and your body will start trusting that balance again. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Hormonal Health Boost helps you support your body’s natural hormone balance through simple daily routines—steady sleep, balanced meals, and mindful rhythm—so your scalp environment moves from stress-driven shedding toward calm stability.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of perimenopausal shedding, when fluctuating estrogen levels can keep hair fall active. Right now, steadying your internal rhythm is your “big domino.” Small hormone-balancing actions—especially around rest, protein, and iron—start nudging your body toward stabilization in the coming months, laying the groundwork for new growth once hormones level out.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your meals</strong> — Eat three balanced meals at roughly the same times daily. Include a palm-sized protein source at each to steady blood sugar and hormone output.</li>\n<li><strong>Pause the late caffeine</strong> — Keep all caffeinated drinks before 3 pm. Your body uses those calmer evening hours to repair and balance cortisol and estrogen signals.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a short wind-down</strong> — Ten minutes of quiet or light stretching before bed signals safety to your nervous system, easing overnight hormone recalibration.</li>\n<li><strong>Iron check-in</strong> — Pair iron‑rich foods (like lentils, fish, or red meat) with vitamin C foods at least twice a day to support oxygen delivery to growing follicles.</li>\n<li><strong>Track one pattern</strong> — Each morning, note your sleep quality and energy. Even small improvements mean your hormones are responding.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable mood by late week, fewer night sweats or sudden temperature swings, and slightly calmer shedding when brushing.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping dinner or eating right before bed—this can spike cortisol and disturb sleep. Aim to finish meals at least 2 hours before bedtime.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced day at a time, your hormones learn peace again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>It’s Time to Calm the Peak and Reclaim Balance 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Mimi, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of shedding — that stretch where hair still feels like it’s thinning faster than it should. Because your main trigger is <strong>ongoing perimenopause</strong>, your body is riding waves of shifting estrogen and progesterone. This week is about helping your system feel safe again through rhythm: steady sleep, calmer evenings, and less caffeine chaos. When your body senses stability, it stops seeing “stress” everywhere — and that’s when shedding begins to ease.</p>\n  <p>These simple practices — your <em>sleep anchor</em>, <em>wind‑down stack</em>, and <em>caffeine fence</em> — aren’t small. They’re the big domino that resets cortisol, rebalances daily hormone patterns, and reopens the nightly repair window your follicles depend on. With 5–6 hours of broken sleep, late caffeine, and frequent night wakings, every bit of structure you add now helps quiet the stress loop that keeps follicles in shedding mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> calms the stress signal that prolongs the shed phase</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper rest:</strong> boosts nighttime growth hormone and scalp circulation</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm:</strong> helps your body find steadier estrogen balance through perimenopause</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Foundation for regrowth:</strong> prepares follicles to respond once stabilization begins mid‑2025</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep and evening rhythm, you’re teaching your body it’s safe to shift from shedding to renewal 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
