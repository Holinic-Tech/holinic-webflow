But perimenopause plus your recent restrictive dieting can still keep cortisol tugging at new growth.

Place one hand over your belly and one over your heart.</li>\n<li><strong>Breathing cycle:</strong> Inhale slowly for a count of 4, hold 1, exhale for 6. Repeat for 15 rounds, sensing your abdomen soften.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind reset:</strong> Picture each exhale releasing tension from your scalp and each inhale feeding it calm circulation.</li>\n<li><strong>Close with note‑to‑self:</strong> Whisper a short affirmation like, “My body knows how to renew,” and rest in stillness for one minute.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week; fewer midnight wake‑ups; a lighter, more relaxed scalp sensation after breathwork.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑day caffeine can undo evening relaxation—set a firm “coffee fence” at 3 p.m.; switch to herbal tea if cravings hit.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each calm breath tells your body it’s safe to shift from shedding toward restoration. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you spot and redirect the tiny daily choices that silently keep your shedding stuck — so you can build steadier routines your hair can finally trust.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kelly, you’re in the stabilization phase — the hardest work is done, but rebuilding needs calm consistency. With stress low and exercise as your main outlet, small energy dips from restrictive eating can trigger “I’ll skip a meal or cut corners” moments that sabotage recovery.

Perimenopause and recent calorie restriction can both mute growth signals. This step is your “big domino”: by smoothing those hormonal ups‑and‑downs now, you create the calm internal environment your follicles need to re‑enter active regrowth by midsummer. Think of it as helping your scalp exhale before it starts creating again.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Eat enough, regularly.</strong> Aim for three balanced meals with at least one palm of protein each.

Gentle winding down prevents night‑time temperature spikes that worsen perimenopausal sleep breaks.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your fuel mood‑tracker.</strong> Note how energy and sleep feel next morning—your feedback loop for whether nourishment is balancing you.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> sleep feels deeper with fewer wake‑ups; energy steadies through the day instead of post‑lunch dips; mood and appetite even out.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping breakfast or keeping late caffeine (after 3 pm) blunts hormonal rhythm—set a daily reminder to close the caffeine gate by early afternoon.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each nourished day lays one quiet brick toward the regrowth phase ahead. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Mental Resilience Training","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Mental Resilience Training","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Hormonal Health Boost","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Creating Calm Foundations for Recovery 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Kelly, you’re now in the stabilization phase — the hardest stretch is behind you. Because your main trigger, perimenopause, is still ongoing and layered with restrictive dieting, your system needs steady signals of safety and nourishment. This week is about helping your body exhale: regulating hormones, quieting cortisol, and reminding your follicles that the crisis is over.</p>\n  <p>With your 6–7 hours of sleep, a few night wakings, and caffeine after 3 pm, your routines have room for gentle upgrades. The practices this week — setting a consistent sleep anchor, building a simple wind‑down stack, and adding a caffeine fence — are the “big domino.” They rebalance your daily rhythm, which in turn steadies cortisol and supports the hormonal feedback loops that protect follicles from further shedding.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress buffer:</strong> deeper, steadier sleep lowers cortisol so follicles can return to normal growth cycles</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm support:</strong> balanced rest helps smooth perimenopausal fluctuations</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Nighttime repair:</strong> more time in deep sleep boosts growth hormone and scalp micro‑circulation</li>\n    <li>🍵 <strong>Caffeine awareness:</strong> curbing late intake reduces restless nights and cortisol spikes</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your bedtime and protect your rest, you’re laying the groundwork for calmer shedding and the first wave of healthy regrowth to follow 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
