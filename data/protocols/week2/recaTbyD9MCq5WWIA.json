{"week2":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Right now your shedding is in \"waves,\" consistent with peak/stress-driven telogen effluvium.

Right now you’re in the peak/stabilization border: months past a thyroid/medication flare, still no baby hairs. Because you don’t yet have a healthy outlet for daily high stress, your cortisol stays jagged and keeps pushing hairs into telogen. This practice—replacing self-sabotage habits with better coping—can be the domino that helps you cross from unstable shedding into steadier ground, so regrowth can start on schedule. ❤️</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Catch your “old reflex” (rumination, isolating, doom scrolling) when stress spikes.</li> \n<li>Swap it with a 5–10 min nervous-system reset: breathing, walk, stretch, journaling.</li> \n<li>Anchor one longer reset (20–30 min) in the evening to drop cortisol before sleep.</li> \n<li>Pair with protein snack if dinner was light—small stabilizer for iron/protein gaps.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Morning: 2 min slow-breath before checking phone.</li> \n<li>Midday: Walk outside after lunch instead of scrolling.</li> \n<li>Evening: 20 min guided relaxation or journaling before bed.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Notice your stress cue (shoulder tension, racing thoughts).</li> \n<li>Interrupt with one chosen “reset” (phone reminder helps at first).</li> \n<li>Experiment with 2–3 tools—keep the one that feels easiest.</li> \n<li>Add a protein/iron-rich snack 2–3x a week at night if meals were skipped.</li> \n<li>Track shedding briefly once a week; focus on trend, not daily numbers.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because stress/anxiety are high and ongoing, these swaps flatten cortisol surges that otherwise prolong telogen shedding.</li> \n<li>Your med change + illness flare overlapped last spring; each added ~3–4 mo lag. Coping resets now shorten time-to-stabilization so regrowth isn’t delayed further.</li> \n<li>Protein/iron gaps plus irregular cycles suggest risk for substrate shortage; evening snacks buffer without strict dieting traps.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Using strict dieting as stress control → worsens shedding. If noticed, refocus on balanced meals.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 1–2 weeks, less night rumination, slightly calmer mornings, stress feels more “contained.”</li> \n<li>Don’t expect baby hairs overnight—your job now is to create calm soil so growth can sprout in the next phase. 🌱</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> <div class=\"big-domino\"> <p>Your shedding comes in waves, which is consistent with hormone-related telogen effluvium layered on top of thyroid/medication stress.
