Repeat for 5 rounds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add a mini body scan:</strong> Notice where you hold tension (jaw, shoulders, belly) and soften it on each exhale.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional upgrade:</strong> Once a week, try a guided yoga nidra or meditation before bed to deepen rest on high‑stress days.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Within 10–14 days, you’ll find your heart rate slows quicker after stress, you fall asleep faster, and your hair shedding stays level even after tough days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Afternoon caffeine can undo your evening calm. Shift that cup to before 2 pm, or swap to herbal tea to support your sleep rhythm.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each calm breath today feeds tomorrow’s stronger strands. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Self‑Sabotage Buster helps you catch those quiet moments when stress pulls you back into draining habits and swap them for soothing choices that actually restore you.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Amb, your main trigger has been chronic stress, and while your shedding has finally steadied and baby hairs are sprouting again, stress still whispers to your hormones every day.

Because your <strong>chronic stress is still ongoing</strong>, this week is all about helping your body feel consistently safe again. The more stable your internal rhythm becomes, the more energy your follicles can devote to building thicker strands instead of staying in defense mode.</p>\n  <p>These first practices—anchoring your bedtime, creating a wind‑down stack, and setting a caffeine fence—work directly on the stress‑sleep axis that drives cortisol levels. You’re already getting about six to seven hours of rest, which is a solid base. Now, by tightening your sleep window and cutting caffeine after 3 pm, you’ll lower nighttime cortisol and allow deeper, longer growth‑hormone cycles to kick in. That’s when follicle repair and collagen formation truly accelerate.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> reduces the “on‑edge” signal that keeps follicles in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Restores hormonal balance:</strong> steadier sleep supports progesterone and thyroid balance behind stronger growth</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Stimulates follicle recovery:</strong> deeper sleep triggers cell renewal at the root</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Builds resilience:</strong> calmer nights make daytime stress less likely to spark another flare‑up</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each evening you protect your sleep boundary, you’re teaching your body it’s safe to regrow—one peaceful night at a time 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
