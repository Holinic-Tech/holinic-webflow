It’s how you train your body’s rhythm to expect rest and renewal at predictable times.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Becky, your hair shedding has steadied — that’s progress. But with high daily stress still active, your body’s repair signals can’t fully switch on. A steady sleep rhythm is your “big domino” right now: it calms stress hormones and lets follicles stay in growth mode, helping you move from stabilization toward visible regrowth over the next few months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Pick your target bedtime and wake-up time — aim for 7+ hours total sleep and times that feel realistic on workdays and weekends.</li>\n  <li>Set reminders an hour before bed to start winding down (no need to do the routine itself here — just mark your cutoff).</li>\n  <li>Commit to staying within a 30-minute window, even on days off. Wake at your set time, use daylight or a short walk to anchor your clock.</li>\n  <li>If you miss your window, simply reset the next night — consistency over time matters far more than perfection.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll start falling asleep faster, waking up more refreshed, and noticing steadier energy by day 7–10.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Emotional-eating late at night can delay sleep; if you crave comfort food, try a warm herbal tea or brief journaling instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one rested morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you quiet your mind and body in the final hour before bed so your nervous system shifts from alert to calm — the state where true recovery and hair repair begin.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Becky, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has leveled, yet high stress is still the main brake holding back regrowth. Evening calm is your “big domino”: when stress hormones drop before sleep, the body can exit fight‑or‑flight and finally refocus on repair. This nightly ritual is how you move from fragile stability toward visible new growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a daily “slow‑down alarm.”</strong> One hour before bed, silence notifications and dim lights to signal your body it’s time to land.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap stimulation for grounding.</strong> Try 5–10 minutes of slow stretching, deep breathing, or gentle journaling instead of screens or news.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a soothing cue.</strong> Play soft instrumental music or light a calming scent while you wash your face and prepare for bed — let that cue become a nightly trigger for relaxation.</li>\n<li><strong>Release the day.</strong> Write down the one thought still circling your mind, then close the notebook and promise to revisit it tomorrow.</li>\n<li><strong>Lights out within the hour.</strong> Consistency is more powerful than perfection; aim for similar timing, even on weekends.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer middle‑of‑the‑night wake‑ups, and waking feeling more refreshed — often noticeable within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating after stress peaks at night can keep adrenaline high. Fix: sip a warm herbal tea or take a brief walk before starting your wind‑down.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time, your body remembers safety and your scalp follows. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p><em>Professional Sleeper</em> helps you turn the hours you already spend in bed into deeply restorative sleep, so your body can finally switch from “survive” mode to “repair and regrow.”</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Becky, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding has plateaued but new sprouts haven’t yet appeared. With chronic stress still humming in the background, deep-quality sleep is what signals your system it’s safe to regrow. This is your “big domino”: mastering recovery sleep now helps calm the stress cycle that’s quietly keeping your follicles on pause.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Morning light charge:</strong> Get natural daylight on your eyes within 30 minutes of waking. Ten minutes outdoors sets your body clock for stronger nighttime melatonin release.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep evenings dim and warm-toned:</strong> Two hours before bed, switch to lamps or warm light. Your brain reads light cues more than clocks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Temperature cue:</strong> About an hour before sleep, lower your room a few degrees or take a slightly warm shower—cooling afterward boosts sleep onset.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bed = sleep sanctuary:</strong> If you can’t drift off after 20 minutes, move to a dim space and read something calming until eyelids feel heavy.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reflection reset:</strong> Before lying down, place a hand on your belly and take three slow breaths, reminding yourself, “This rest grows my roots back.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up less groggy, falling asleep within 15–20 minutes, steadier mood within a week.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> High evening stress or emotional eating right before bed can spike nighttime cortisol. If cravings hit, try a protein-rich snack earlier and a few slow exhales instead of scrolling.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time, your body learns safety again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Your Body’s Signal to Pause and Reset 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Becky, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has steadied after a long period of stress‑driven loss. Because your chronic stress is still ongoing, this week is about teaching your body safety again through rhythm and rest. When your system senses consistency, it stops guarding energy and starts preparing for regrowth.</p>\n  <p>Sleep is the single most powerful stabilizer for hair recovery. During deep sleep, cortisol levels drop, growth and thyroid hormones rebalance, and your follicles shift out of the “pause” mode they enter during prolonged stress. With your 6–7 hours of somewhat variable sleep, anchoring a steady bedtime and gentle wind‑down will quiet your stress loop faster than any supplement could.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Neurocalm:</strong> steady sleep timing retrains your nervous system to reduce cortisol spikes</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> balanced melatonin and growth hormone support healthy follicle cycling</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle repair:</strong> deeper nightly recovery gives roots energy to hold and thicken strands</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Stress buffer:</strong> consistent rest builds resilience so daily challenges don’t restart shedding</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your chosen bedtime and wind‑down, you’re telling your body it’s safe to regrow — one calm evening at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
