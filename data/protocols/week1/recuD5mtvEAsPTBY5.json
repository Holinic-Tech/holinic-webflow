{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Toby, your shedding is still in the worsening window, and your body hasn’t hit stabilization yet. Because late coffee cuts into your already short 6 hours of sleep, your cortisol stays higher through the night. That extra stress signal keeps more follicles stuck in “shedding mode.” Setting a caffeine cut‑off is the single lever that helps you slide into deeper sleep, flatten stress hormones, and move from the peak of loss into stabilization 🌙.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Keep all caffeine before 2 pm — coffee, tea, energy drinks.</li> \n<li>Stick to a max of 2 cups in the first half of the day.</li> \n<li>Switch to decaf/herbal after lunch if you want the ritual.</li> \n<li>Pair your last caffeine with food to soften any jitters.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Wake: set a fixed anchor (e.g. 7:00 am) daily.</li> \n<li>Bedtime: aim 11:00 pm latest → 8h sleep window.</li> \n<li>No caffeine past 2:00 pm to protect deep sleep cycles.</li> \n<li>Last meal: 2–3h before bed if possible, to avoid night wake‑ups.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Notice when you currently crave your “afternoon boost.”</li> \n<li>Shift that cup to before 1:45 pm this week.</li> \n<li>Keep a decaf/herbal option ready for the 3–5 pm slump.</li> \n<li>Pair caffeine with protein at breakfast/lunch to stabilize energy.</li> \n<li>Set a gentle reminder alarm at 2 pm: “Caffeine cut‑off.”</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your high stress + late caffeine = elevated night cortisol → follicle exit. Cutting off earlier lowers that signal so hairs stop prematurely shedding.</li> \n<li>Your worst trigger (major illness Jan–May) means lagged fallout now. By protecting sleep now, you shorten the time to stabilization, so regrowth can start on schedule.</li> \n<li>Anxiety/rumination are less intense when sleep deepens, giving your system more repair hormones (progesterone, thyroid signals) that encourage stronger regrowth.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If you push caffeine later “just this once,” expect more tossing at night → notice extra shedding 1–2 days later; reset quickly.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 7–10 days you wake less groggy, fall asleep faster, and notice fewer “clumps” on wash days.</li> \n<li>Remember — this is about protecting your sleep like a shield 🌱. Small, steady shifts matter more than perfection.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice2_html":null,"practice3_html":null,"practice1_title":"Practice 1: Caffeine Cut Off","practice2_title":"Practice 2: ","practice3_title":"Practice 3: "}}
