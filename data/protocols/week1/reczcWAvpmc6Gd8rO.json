But because your main trigger (ongoing rapid weight loss) is still stressing your system, the fastest way to help your follicles hold on is by locking in stability through sleep and daily rhythm. That’s why this week’s practices are all about giving your body the clearest “it’s safe” message possible.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your short nights (<5h), 2–3 wakings, and late caffeine are keeping stress hormones elevated well into the evening. This delays the deep sleep phases where growth hormone and repair signals peak — the very window your follicles rely on to reset. By anchoring a consistent bedtime, protecting your evenings with a simple wind-down, and cutting off caffeine earlier, you’re stacking three powerful levers that directly calm cortisol, balance hormones, and free up nutrients for repair instead of survival mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress load:</strong> predictable sleep signals reduce cortisol that keeps follicles in “shed mode.”</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> deeper sleep helps smooth monthly cycles and supports scalp balance.</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Repair time unlocked:</strong> growth hormone in deep sleep fuels fresh hair cell turnover.</li>\n    <li>☕ <strong>Clearer evenings:</strong> earlier caffeine cut-off helps your brain drop into restful stages faster.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you anchor your bedtime and protect your wind-down, you nudge your body out of stress mode and closer to steady shedding and visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
