{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n <div class=\"big-domino\">\n  <p>Toby, your shedding is still in waves and you haven’t yet seen baby hairs. With high stress, irregular periods, and ongoing thyroid/med changes, your body is stuck in “onset/peak” territory. The single domino that steadies this cycle is <strong>locking in sleep timing</strong>—because stable circadian rhythm flattens the stress-hormone swings that keep pushing hairs into telogen. 🌙</p>\n </div>\n <div class=\"what-to-do\">\n  <h4>What to do</h4>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Pick one bedtime and wake time—keep both within a 30‑min window every day.</li>\n   <li>Get light to your eyes within 30 min of waking (natural light if possible).</li>\n   <li>Cut off caffeine after noon; avoid meals right before bed to aid deep sleep.</li>\n   <li>Make your sleep space dark, cool, and quiet for longer stretches of deep sleep.</li>\n  </ul>\n </div>\n <div class=\"sleep-schedule\">\n  <h4>Your recommended schedule</h4>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Bedtime: 10:45–11:15 pm (lights out by 11)</li>\n   <li>Wake: 7:00–7:30 am (anchor wake every day, even Sunday)</li>\n   <li>8h sleep window supports recovery + growth signals</li>\n  </ul>\n </div>\n <div class=\"steps\">\n  <h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4>\n  <ol>\n   <li>Set a nightly “wind‑down alarm” at 10:15 pm to step away from screens and journaling rumination.</li>\n   <li>Keep caffeine cutoff at 12 pm; switch to water or herbal tea afterward.</li>\n   <li>Eat dinner earlier (ideally 2h before bed) so digestion doesn’t delay repair cycles.</li>\n   <li>On high‑stress days, add a simple 5‑minute breathing exercise before lights out to calm cortisol.</li>\n   <li>Keep bedroom cool and dark; use blackout shade or eye mask if dawn light wakes you.</li>\n  </ol>\n </div>\n <div class=\"why-it-works\">\n  <h4>Why this works (for you)</h4>\n  <ul>\n   <li>Because your chronic thyroid/medication stress is ongoing, regular sleep cues lower night cortisol spikes that otherwise delay shedding stabilization.</li>\n   <li>Your shed waves fit with TE lag: illness (Feb) + meds (Mar–May) likely pushed hairs into telogen in summer. Consistency here shortens the lag window so regrowth can begin on time.</li>\n   <li>Irregular cycles + possible low iron = fragile hair substrate. Deep, stable sleep improves progesterone/thyroid tone, which protects follicles until nutrients catch up.</li>\n  </ul>\n </div>\n <div class=\"watch-outs\">\n  <h4>What to look out for</h4>\n  <ul>\n   <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Staying up >90 min past your set bedtime regularly → pushes back your hormone rhythm. If this happens often, reset by anchoring wake time, not bedtime.</li>\n   <li><strong>Green lights:</strong> By week 2, anxiety at night feels calmer; by week 3, sleep onset is faster; shedding feels steadier (less “wavey”).</li>\n   <li>Be patient with yourself—consistency, not perfection, moves you toward stabilization ❤️.</li>\n  </ul>\n </div>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Consistent Sleep Timing"}}
