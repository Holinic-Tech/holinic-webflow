This steady rhythm helps your body’s repair systems work like clockwork—so your scalp and follicles can stay calm and in sync.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, you’re in the stabilization phase, right as your body is recovering from that extended injury earlier this year. Keeping your sleep and wake times consistent is your “big domino” now—it anchors your hormones and healing signals so they can shift from stress mode to steady growth. Each aligned night moves you closer to the regrowth window expected this coming spring. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose your anchor times:</strong> Pick a target bedtime and wake time that fit your current lifestyle and allow at least eight hours of rest. Write them down.</li>\n  <li><strong>Set gentle boundaries:</strong> Start winding down when you see your bedtime approaching—no major tasks or screens that can delay it.</li>\n  <li><strong>Weekend consistency:</strong> Aim to keep weekends within 30 minutes of your usual schedule. If you stay up later, still wake close to your anchor time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track it:</strong> Use a phone reminder or quick journal line (“In bed: 10:20 pm”) for the next 14 days to build pattern awareness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reassess after two weeks:</strong> Notice how mornings and shedding feel. Adjust your anchors only if truly needed—otherwise, hold steady.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking with easier energy, steadier mood through the afternoon, and fewer “extra” hairs on your wash days within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> It’s easy to drift later scrolling your phone in bed—set “Do Not Disturb” 30 minutes before lights out to protect your anchor.</li>\n  <li>Consistency stacks quietly—each aligned night tells your body, “It’s safe to repair now.” Keep that rhythm; your follicles are listening. ✨</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Wind Down Protocol helps you gently transition from day mode to rest mode, guiding your body and mind to slow down so you can drift into deeper, restorative sleep every night.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, you’re in your stabilization phase — the moment your scalp finally gets to reset after months of stress and recovery from injury. Your sleep is already strong, but a deliberate wind‑down helps reinforce the hormonal calm your follicles need to shift from shedding to rebuilding. Think of this ritual as your nightly signal that safety has returned and growth can quietly restart under the surface.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a nightly off‑ramp:</strong> About 45 minutes before bed, dim lights and silence notifications. Let your body recognize the cue that activity is winding down.</li>\n<li><strong>Do one grounding ritual:</strong> A few minutes of slow breathing or light stretching releases lingering tension without stimulating you again.</li>\n<li><strong>Reflect and release:</strong> Jot down one thing you appreciated today; it calms the mind and steadies mood before sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Ease transition:</strong> Slip your phone out of reach and switch to soft light (a lamp or candle). Let sensory quiet take over.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep faster and wake once or not at all; mornings feel steadier; daytime focus improves within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Occasional “just one more scroll” can keep your mind buzzing—set a reminder to dock your phone at wind‑down start time.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one peaceful night teaches your system that the hard season is behind you. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you transform good sleep into restorative, growth‑supporting sleep. It’s about becoming intentional with light, temperature, and morning movement so your body’s clock and hair‑repair hormones sync naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, your shedding is easing after hard months of physical stress, placing you in stabilization — the bridge between loss and regrowth. Deep, high‑quality sleep is your “big domino” now because it finalizes recovery from your injury while signaling follicles to move out of rest. The steadier your circadian rhythm, the faster you’ll cross into the first visible regrowth wave by spring. 🌙</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor your morning light:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, step outside or to a bright window for 10 minutes. Natural light is your circadian reset button.</li>\n  <li><strong>Move early:</strong> Do gentle movement — a short walk, stretches, or sun salutations — soon after that light exposure to wake cortisol naturally and signal “daytime” to your body.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cool your cave:</strong> In the last hour before bed, drop the bedroom temperature to around 65–68°F (18–20°C). Cooler air helps melatonin rise and supports overnight tissue repair.</li>\n  <li><strong>Limit bright overheads at night:</strong> Swap ceiling lights for softer lamps or amber bulbs two hours before sleep to mimic sunset and cue melatonin production.</li>\n  <li><strong>Create a wake‑up finale:</strong> When you open your eyes, stand and stretch instead of lingering in bed — this small cue speeds morning alertness and prevents grogginess spillover.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll start waking with less grogginess, feel calmer through the afternoon, and notice your scalp feels less “hot” or stressed within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Staying indoors all morning can dull your rhythm — if it’s raining, open a window or use a bright‑light box for 10 minutes.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — each sunrise you greet helps anchor healing from the inside out. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Bring Your Body Back to Steady Ground 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Katelynn, you’re now in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — the hardest wave of shedding has passed, and your system is learning that the danger from your <strong>injury with blood loss</strong> is over.
