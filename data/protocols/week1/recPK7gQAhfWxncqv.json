When your body knows exactly when to rest, your hormones and repair cycles line up effortlessly, giving your scalp the signal that it’s safe to grow again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, your shedding has steadied but new growth hasn’t kicked in yet. In this stabilization phase, consistency is what unlocks the regrowth window ahead. Anchoring your sleep rhythm steadies cortisol and thyroid signaling—often the quiet saboteurs of hair recovery after long-term imbalances. This one habit will help shift your system from “hold” to “rebuild” before your expected regrowth start early next year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your anchor times.</strong> Pick a bedtime and wake-up goal that match your natural rhythm—around when you already feel sleepy and refreshed.</li>\n<li><strong>Commit to a 60‑minute window.</strong> Aim to be in bed within 30 minutes of your chosen bedtime, and wake within 30 minutes of your target wake time—even on weekends.</li>\n<li><strong>Use light cues.</strong> Step into daylight within an hour of waking; dim lights 60 min before bed. This locks your internal clock.</li>\n<li><strong>Track consistency.</strong> Jot a quick note each morning: “On time,” “+30,” or “–30.” Small awareness keeps patterns steady.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your baseline.</strong> If you travel or stay out late, resume your normal pattern the very next night—your body resets fast when you do.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer night awakenings, and waking clear-headed within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Letting screens stretch bedtime past your anchor. Quick fix: set a “lights-dim” reminder 45 min before bed.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one aligned night at a time. 🌙 Your hair (and hormones) will thank you for the predictability.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps your body shift out of “day‑mode” so you can fall asleep faster, sleep deeper, and let repair hormones do their nightly work without interruption.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has calmed but your roots are still refilling their nutrient stores. Because your biggest driver looks nutritional and hormonal, deep restorative sleep is the single lever that multiplies every nutrient you add. This routine will cue your body’s natural growth rhythm, moving you toward visible baby hairs by early spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a nightly “last light” time about 45 minutes before bed — lights dim, phone down, signals quiet.</li>\n<li>Start a 5‑minute grounding cue: 3 slow breaths, light stretch, or writing one calming thought to park the day.</li>\n<li>Wash or pin back hair, apply a gentle scalp massage for 2–3 minutes — let warmth tell your system, “time to recover.”</li>\n<li>Keep the same order each night (dim → ground → massage → bed). Familiar rhythm trains your hormones faster than willpower alone.</li>\n<li>If worry creeps in, jot it on paper, set it aside, and promise morning attention — not midnight rumination.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> falling asleep 10–15 minutes faster, waking with steadier energy, and noticing calmer shedding during morning comb‑outs within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> scrolling news or messages in that final quiet window — it restarts adrenaline. Quick fix: enable airplane mode once you dim the lights.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you create the kind of deep, unbroken sleep that allows your body—and your hair follicles—to fully repair overnight. It’s about turning good nightly rest into a growth-activating superpower.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, you’re in the stabilization phase—shedding has steadied, yet your scalp hasn’t sparked visible new growth just yet. This is the moment your follicles quietly recharge. By training your body to reach true restorative sleep, you lower the stress chemicals that still whisper “hold back” to those new hairs. Mastering this now is your big domino toward regrowth by early 2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Morning light first thing:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, step outside or by a bright window for at least 10 minutes. This anchors your body clock for deeper sleep at night.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep a single wake target:</strong> Choose a fixed wake-up time (within a 15‑min window), including weekends. Your bedtime can float as needed, but rising consistently teaches your brain when to produce melatonin.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reserve your bed for sleep only:</strong> No reading, phones, or lists once you lie down—this builds a cue that “bed = switch off.”</li>\n  <li><strong>Cool and dark:</strong> Crack a window or shed one blanket so your core temperature falls easily; darkness signals melatonin to rise naturally.</li>\n  <li><strong>Midday reset:</strong> Around 2–4 p.m., step away from screens and stretch or walk briefly to break the afternoon fatigue cycle that can stall nighttime rest.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll start falling asleep faster, waking at nearly the same time without an alarm, and noticing calmer mornings within 10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you linger on your phone in bed “just for a quick scroll,” your mind re‑associates the space with alertness. Quick fix: set your charger across the room before lying down.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each solid night tells your body, “It’s safe to grow again.” Keep stacking those wins, one restful morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑teaching Your Body That It’s Safe to Grow Again 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Eeva, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has finally leveled off, but new growth hasn’t yet shown up. Because your main trigger is a gradual nutritional or hormonal imbalance that’s still gently ongoing, this week is about helping your nervous and hormonal systems feel steady enough to allow regrowth to begin. The most direct way to do that is through consistent, restorative sleep.</p>\n  <p>Your answers show you get 7–8 hours of rest but drift 30–60 minutes in bedtime. That small inconsistency keeps your body clock and cortisol rhythm slightly out of sync, which can delay the hormonal “green light” follicles need to re‑enter growth. The practices this week — setting a consistent sleep anchor, building a gentle wind‑down, and learning the science of deep recovery — are the big domino that calms stress chemistry and restores nutrient use for your scalp.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Steadier cortisol rhythm:</strong> lowers background stress that keeps follicles on alert</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Improved hormone balance:</strong> supports thyroid and estrogen signals that govern hair cycles</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Better nutrient absorption:</strong> your iron and protein intake can finally be used for repair</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper sleep phases:</strong> trigger growth hormone release that energizes dormant follicles</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you hold your bedtime steady, you tell your body “the storm is over.” That message is what begins the quiet shift from stable shedding to visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
