{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Consistent Sleep Timing means choosing one bedtime and wake time—and sticking within 30 minutes of those—so your body gets into a steady rhythm that calms stress hormones and steadies hair growth signals.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Eva, you’re in the stabilization phase—your follicles are still fragile, yet new baby hairs show they’re fighting back. With your shift-style schedule and ongoing stress, irregular sleep is likely keeping your nervous system on alert. Anchoring your sleep window is your “big domino” now: it tells your body it’s safe, steadies hormones behind stress shedding, and moves you toward steady regrowth through spring. 🌙</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a bedtime you can keep most nights—even workdays. Aim for a 60–90 minute pre-sleep wind‑down before that time.</li>\n    <li>Set your alarm for a consistent wake‑up, allowing 7–8 hours of total sleep.</li>\n    <li>Keep both bedtime and wake time within a 30‑minute window, even on weekends or days off.</li>\n    <li>If a night runs late, still wake near your usual time—squeeze in a 20‑minute nap later instead of sleeping in.</li>\n    <li>After one full week, notice how your morning mood and shedding patterns begin to stabilize.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking without that wired‑but‑tired feeling, gentler morning shedding, and calmer energy through your day within 10–14 nights.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night doom scrolling can steal your consistent bedtime—set a “screens off” reminder 45 min before bed to protect the rhythm.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—each aligned night signals your body to shift from survival back to growth. You’re already on your way. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently guide your body and mind out of “go‑mode” so you can fall asleep easily and stay asleep through the night. By training your nervous system to expect rest, sleep quality rises naturally and shedding-triggering stress hormones start to settle.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, you’re in the stabilization phase — the hardest part is likely behind you. But with emotional and chronic stress still active, your body needs nightly cues that the day is finished. This is your big domino: consistent decompression each evening tells your follicles that safety has returned, supporting the baby hairs already sprouting and moving you steadily toward full regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a “digital sunset.”</strong> Choose a time one hour before bed when screens go off — no doom scrolling, messages, or news. Dim lights and silence notifications.</li>\n  <li><strong>Create a bridging ritual.</strong> Try a slow shower, gentle stretch, or brief journaling about three things you accomplished today. This signals emotional closure to your nervous system.</li>\n  <li><strong>Bring calm into the body.</strong> Spend 5 minutes with belly breathing: inhale for 4, exhale for 6, noticing your shoulders drop each round.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep a comfort cue.</strong> As you slip into bed, listen to a soft instrumental track or repeat a simple gratitude phrase — one sensory cue repeated nightly becomes your body’s “sleep password.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, waking more refreshed, and noticing calmer evenings with less racing thought before bed.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> The urge to scroll after lights out — it tricks your brain into alertness. Quick fix: leave your phone outside the bedroom and keep a paperback nearby instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time, your system relearns safety, and your roots follow that cue. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you master the small daytime habits that set up the deepest nighttime rest. It’s about teaching your brain when to be alert and when to switch off — so your body’s repair hormones can do their quiet work overnight.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is easing, but your follicles still need steady, nightly repair time. Because long‑term stress and irregular sleep patterns have been major triggers for you, this practice is your big domino: learning to protect sleep quality will smooth hormones and support those new baby hairs turning into true regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Bright start:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, get natural light on your eyes for at least 10 minutes. This anchors your body clock so your evening melatonin can rise on time.</li>\n<li><strong>Daytime movement:</strong> Add a short walk or gentle stretch in the mid‑afternoon to reduce stress hormones that can delay your sleep drive.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature cue:</strong> Keep your room cool (around 65–68 °F / 18–20 °C) and wear lighter layers; the drop in body temperature signals “time to rest.”</li>\n<li><strong>Digital taper:</strong> One hour before bed, shift screens away from your face or use night mode; blue light confuses your brain’s clock.</li>\n<li><strong>Morning consistency:</strong> Even with shift work, choose one consistent wake window on days off — this keeps your rhythm from resetting every weekend.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster; fewer mid‑night awakenings; clearer morning focus within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night doom scrolling can sneak back in when you feel stressed. Quick fix — set your phone to grayscale after 9 p.m. and leave it charging across the room.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady wake‑up at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reset Your Inner Clock to Calm the Cycle 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Eva, you’re now in the stabilization phase — shedding has eased since its March–April peak, but emotional and chronic stress are still influencing your system. This week’s focus on consistent sleep and gentle wind‑down rituals is your way to tell your body: “It’s safe now — you can stop shedding.” Because your main trigger is ongoing stress, anchoring your sleep rhythm is the most direct way to steady your hormones and let follicles stay in their growth stage longer.</p>\n  <p>When bedtime happens at the same hour each night, your brain starts predicting rest. Cortisol levels drop earlier, melatonin rises naturally, and growth hormone pulses during deep sleep — the quiet repair window when hair‑matrix cells restore themselves. Even though you average 7–8 hours, your shifting schedule from night work keeps your circadian rhythm guessing; these practices bring it back into sync so your hair can trust the signal to regrow.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> Predictable sleep lowers cortisol and quiets the “fight or flight” loop driving ongoing shedding.</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> Helps rebalance estrogen‑androgen rhythms impacted by stress and PCOS history.</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> Deep, regular rest lets growth factors repair the bulb and extend the growth phase.</li>\n    <li>💖 <strong>Nervous‑system safety:</strong> Wind‑down cues teach your body to relax without doom‑scrolling or tension carry‑over.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you honor your chosen bedtime, you’re teaching your body safety again — and each calm morning brings you closer to steady strands and visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
