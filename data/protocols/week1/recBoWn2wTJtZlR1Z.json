It trains your body’s internal clock so rest feels deeper, steadier, and easier to maintain — no matter what the day brings.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is easing and new hairs are already sprouting. After childbirth, steady sleep timing helps your hormones and thyroid rhythm settle, keeping regrowth signals strong. This is your “big domino”: once your body knows when to rest and rise, everything else — mood, energy, and hair recovery — starts syncing more smoothly toward your regrowth window in May 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick one target bedtime that feels realistic (for example, 10:30 pm) and one wake‑up time that allows at least 7 hours of sleep.</li>\n<li>Set a reminder on your phone 30 minutes before bedtime to start winding down — this is your cue to dim lights and finish tasks.</li>\n<li>Keep the window tight: aim to fall asleep and wake within that 30‑minute range, even on weekends or days off.</li>\n<li>If your baby or family schedule shifts a night, reset as soon as possible — one missed night doesn’t undo progress.</li>\n<li>Track consistency for one week; highlight wins, not perfection. You’re just asking your body for rhythm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling less groggy in the morning, falling asleep faster, and noticing steadier daytime energy within 7–10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Irregular bedtime scrolling can sneak in — if you find yourself reaching for the phone, leave it to charge in another room and keep a dim lamp by your bed instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one aligned night at a time, you’re giving your body the calm rhythm it needs to grow stronger hair. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps your body gently shift from “go mode” to rest mode, so sleep comes easier and feels deeper. It’s about creating a short evening rhythm that signals your nervous system, “Day’s done.”</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re in your stabilization phase — shedding is easing and baby hairs are sprouting. Right now, steady, restorative sleep is your recovery fuel. After the hormonal rollercoaster of postpartum months, this practice anchors your stress and energy rhythm, helping your scalp stay in its calm, rebuilding state as you move toward visible regrowth this spring. It’s your nightly reset button.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a gentle cue.</strong> Choose one calming signal to start your wind down — dim lights, soft music, or stretching. Repeat it nightly so your body learns the cue.</li>\n  <li><strong>Close loops early.</strong> About 60 minutes before bed, write down any “mental to‑dos.” Let the page hold them so your mind doesn’t have to.</li>\n  <li><strong>Transition the senses.</strong> Turn off bright screens, apply your night cream or oil slowly, and breathe deeply through each step.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protect your quiet pocket.</strong> Keep this routine yours — even 15 minutes makes a difference if done consistently.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer night wakings, waking with less morning tension within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Scrolling on your phone “just for a minute” before sleep can restart your stress loop — keep the phone outside the bedroom or on airplane mode.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm evening at a time, your body remembers safety, and your roots follow. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you treat sleep like a skill — not a luxury. By training your body to make deep, consistent rest your default, your hormones, scalp circulation, and recovery all sync back into balance naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re in the stabilization phase — your shedding is easing and those baby hairs are proof that recovery is in motion. After childbirth, your system is recalibrating, and the best thing you can do now is lock in truly restorative sleep. That’s your “big domino”: when your nightly recovery deepens, stress hormones calm and your postpartum cycles, iron levels, and regrowth rhythm settle faster.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Brightness discipline:</strong> Get 5–10 minutes of outdoor light within 30 minutes of waking to anchor your circadian rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature cue:</strong> Keep your bedroom between 18–20 °C. A slightly cooler environment tells your body to drop into deeper slow‑wave sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Digital sunset:</strong> Two hours before bed, dim overhead lights and enable warm screen filters or switch to audiobooks/podcasts instead of scrolling.</li>\n<li><strong>Set your sleep stage:</strong> Ten minutes before bed, stretch or do slow belly breathing — enough to signal “day off, recovery on.”</li>\n<li><strong>Morning consistency:</strong> Wake within the same 30–60 minute window daily, even on weekends, so your hormones stay aligned.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep faster, wake up once or less per night, and feel clearer by midday instead of foggy.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you scroll or watch screens in bright light late at night, melatonin release is delayed. Quick fix — move that screen time to earlier and dim lighting after 8 pm.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm, well‑rested night at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reset Your Rhythm to Lock In Recovery 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Simona, you’re entering the stabilization phase after your postpartum shedding peak — the point where your body is finally calming down from the hormonal rollercoaster that started around August 2025. This week is all about helping your system feel steady and predictable again so those new baby hairs you’re seeing can keep growing without interruption.</p>\n  <p>Your main practices — consistent sleep timing, a gentle wind‑down, and deeper rest — are the “big domino” right now. When sleep becomes regular, cortisol levels drop, thyroid and estrogen signals rebalance, and follicles stay longer in their growth phase. With your fairly consistent 7–8 hours of rest and only one night waking, fine‑tuning timing and quality gives your body the clear message: it’s safe to rebuild.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets your stress rhythm:</strong> steady sleep lowers cortisol, helping shedding settle for good</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances postpartum hormones:</strong> consistent rest supports estrogen and thyroid recovery</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Extends the growth phase:</strong> follicles stay nourished and active longer overnight</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Boosts nutrient use:</strong> iron and protein are directed toward repair instead of stress response</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you reinforce stability — and bring yourself closer to thicker, stronger regrowth in the months ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
