This anchors your internal clock so your body releases restorative hormones on cue, supporting steadier growth and calmer shedding.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Meghan, you’re in the stabilization phase — baby hairs are showing, which means follicles are waking back up. But your chronic stress is still active, and your sleep varies by up to an hour. Locking in a steady sleep rhythm now is the “big domino” that steadies your cortisol cycle and keeps new growth protected as you move toward full regrowth next season.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a target bedtime that realistically allows 7–8 hours of sleep — for example, 10:30 pm.</li>\n<li>For the next 21 days, start winding down about 45 min before that time and commit to lights‑out within your 30‑minute window.</li>\n<li>Set your alarm for the same wake‑up window daily; let natural light hit your eyes soon after rising.</li>\n<li>If weekends throw you off, adjust weekday times slightly earlier so the difference stays under 30 minutes.</li>\n<li>Track your energy and morning mood — small improvements here show your rhythm is syncing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster; fewer middle‑of‑night wakeups; steadier morning energy within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating late in the evening can delay sleep — swap with a calming tea or brief journal entry to release stress before bed.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one anchored bedtime at a time, your body learns safety again and your hair follows. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you shift from “go mode” to “restore mode” each night, so your body can sink into deeper, calmer sleep — the kind that supports steady hair growth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Meghan, your shedding is easing but stress remains your main trigger. In this stabilization phase, your body needs predictable calm every evening to lock in recovery. A gentle wind-down tells your system: “The danger has passed.” It steadies cortisol and protects those reactivating follicles — your biggest domino toward lasting regrowth through spring.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Set your cue.</strong> Pick a fixed 30‑minute window before bed when screens go off and lights dim. This simple boundary starts the shift to rest mode.</li>\n    <li><strong>Signal safety.</strong> Brew a caffeine‑free tea or do slow breathing: in for 4 counts, out for 6. Let your shoulders drop as you exhale.</li>\n    <li><strong>Write it out.</strong> Keep a small notebook at your bedside. Jot down racing thoughts or to‑dos so your mind knows they’re handled.</li>\n    <li><strong>Emotional reset.</strong> Since emotional eating is your go‑to coping habit, replace evening snacking with a short self‑soothing ritual — maybe gentle stretching while listening to calm music.</li>\n    <li><strong>Lights out consistency.</strong> Aim to hit bed within an hour of the previous night’s time. Your nervous system thrives on that rhythm.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer 2–3 a.m. wake‑ups, and waking up without a stress hangover within 10 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night scrolling can slip in and delay melatonin. Keep your phone on charge in another room after your cue time.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm evening at a time. 🌙 Each night you honour this routine, your body learns it’s safe to grow again.</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you treat rest like an essential skill — noticing how light, temperature, and timing influence how deeply you repair overnight so your body can divert more resources to growth, including your hair.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Meghan, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding still swings, but those new baby hairs say follicles are reawakening. Because ongoing stress remains your top trigger, sleep quality is your “big domino.” When nightly recovery deepens, cortisol steadies and the repair wave that began under the surface after your injury can finally lock in. This week, your job is to make recovery non‑negotiable.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Catch the morning light.</strong> Within 30 min of waking, get outside for 5–10 min. Natural light resets your body clock better than any supplement.</li>\n<li><strong>Set an evening dim point.</strong> Two hours before bed, reduce overhead lighting and switch to warmer tones; this trains your brain that darkness equals safety and rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Drop your core temperature.</strong> Keep the bedroom between 18–20 °C (65–68 °F) or use a light blanket so your body can cool — a key sign that it’s time to release growth hormones.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor one constant wake-up time.</strong> Choose a wake time you can hold even on weekends; consistency tells your internal clock that stress no longer runs your schedule.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect the last 10 minutes.</strong> Lie down, place one hand over your belly, and take five slow breaths. Let each exhale remind you: “I did enough today.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling naturally sleepy around the same evening time, fewer night wakings (from 2–3 down to 1 or none), and waking without the jittery rush to “go.”</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Rumination at night can spike cortisol. Keep a notepad by the bed; if thoughts spiral, jot them down and tell yourself they’ll wait for morning.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, Meghan — each calm, steady night is another quiet signal to your follicles: it’s safe to grow again. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reclaiming Calm So Your Follicles Can Breathe Again 🌿</h4>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase — the toughest part is behind you, but your system still needs consistent signals of safety to fully switch from shedding to regrowth. Because your main trigger, chronic stress, is still active, this week’s focus on sleep rhythm is your fastest way to steady both your nervous system and your scalp.</p>\n  <p>When you go to bed at a consistent time and allow your body to wind down gently, you lower cortisol and let melatonin and growth hormones do their quiet overnight repair work. With your current 7–8 hours of sleep but frequent night wakings, these practices will help your brain and follicles sync their recovery cycles again.
