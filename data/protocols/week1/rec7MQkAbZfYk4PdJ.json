{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Consistent Sleep Timing helps you train your body clock by going to bed and waking up at nearly the same time every day, even on weekends. That regular rhythm teaches your hormones and nervous system when to rest and when to repair.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is still active but close to leveling out. Because stress has been your strongest ongoing trigger, keeping your sleep schedule steady is your “big domino.” It calms cortisol swings that keep follicles stuck in shed mode and helps reset the nightly rhythm your perimenopausal body craves as you move toward regrowth this year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose your anchor bedtime — one you can maintain daily (for example, 10:30 PM).</li>\n<li>Set a wake time that gives you roughly 7–8 hours, and stick to both within a 30-minute window, even on weekends.</li>\n<li>Use a subtle evening cue (like dimming lights or turning off bright screens) 30 minutes before bed to signal wind-down time.</li>\n<li>In the morning, get light on your face within 15 minutes of waking — it locks your body rhythm in place.</li>\n<li>Log your bedtime and wake time for 7 nights; review the pattern at week’s end to see how it feels.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster by nights 3–5, waking up fewer times by week 2, and quieter morning stress (less “wired” feeling on waking).</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Staying up late after unwinding with a drink — that drifts your clock. Fix it by choosing a light non-alcoholic ritual and heading to bed within your set window.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds your calm — one synced bedtime at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you ease out of “go‑mode” before sleep, so your mind quiets and your stress hormones settle naturally. It’s a short, nightly ritual that teaches your body it’s safe to rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, your body has been running on alert for years under chronic stress and perimenopausal shifts — both key reasons shedding hasn’t eased yet. As you enter the stabilization phase, this practice is your big domino: each calmer evening signals your follicles to stay anchored longer, paving the way toward regrowth by mid‑year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a soft cutoff:</strong> Pick a “wind‑down start” 45 min before bed when screens, messages, and stimulating tasks pause.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a bridge routine:</strong> Dim lights, change into soft clothes, and do a simple cue — maybe brushing out your hair slowly or gentle neck stretches — to tell your body it’s shifting gears.</li>\n<li><strong>Unplug the noise:</strong> Place your phone on charge outside the bedroom. If worries surface, jot them on paper, then leave the list behind.</li>\n<li><strong>Ease your senses:</strong> Listen to calm instrumental music or a grounding audio (no lyrics). Focus on breathing deeply — four counts in, six out — for five rounds.</li>\n<li><strong>Lock in a signal:</strong> Each night finish with the same small act — a warm face wash or applying your favorite oil — so your brain learns: “this means rest.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, fewer 2–3 am wake‑ups, and waking a touch more refreshed.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Habitual late scrolling or news checking can spike night stress. Quick fix — move your charger to a different room so it’s out of reach.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds calm; calm builds growth — one peaceful evening at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Deep Sleep Activation helps your body claim truly restorative rest by understanding how alcohol affects your sleep cycles. It’s not about quitting — it’s about knowing the cost of those extra glasses and learning small shifts that let you wake up calmer and more refreshed.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, you’re in the stabilization phase, where your body is trying to steady shedding that’s been ongoing through stress and perimenopause. Because you’re waking multiple times a night and drink more than three evenings a week, sleep depth is likely the missing piece. Improving it is your big domino — once you restore true rest, your stress hormones settle, helping shedding quiet and regrowth prepare to begin this summer.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Track your evenings:</strong> For three nights, jot down what and when you drink — even one glass — and note how you sleep (how many times you wake).</li>\n  <li><strong>Set a two-hour cut‑off:</strong> Leave at least two hours between your last sip and lights out. This lets your body clear alcohol before the restorative sleep stages begin.</li>\n  <li><strong>Swap stress‑relief cues:</strong> On 1–2 nights this week, replace a drink with a calming ritual — a shower, magnesium tea, or a few deep breaths and journaling.</li>\n  <li><strong>Notice the shift:</strong> Pay attention to how your mornings feel — energy, mood, even scalp tenderness often improve within days of deeper sleep.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer night awakenings, steadier mood on waking, and less midday craving for caffeine or sugar within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Habit‑based “I deserve this” glass after stressful days — pause first, breathe for 30 seconds, then decide if you still want it.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — every rested night helps your follicles feel secure again. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Deep Sleep Activation","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Your Calm Foundation: Bringing Stability Back to Your System 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Jet, you’re now in the <em>stabilization phase</em> — that plateau where shedding still happens, but your body is primed to steady itself. Because your main trigger, chronic stress since 2020, is still ongoing and layered with perimenopausal changes, this week is all about sending your body the clearest possible signal that it’s safe to slow the shed cycle.</p>\n  <p>This week’s core practices — consistent sleep timing, a gentle wind-down, and smarter alcohol choices — are the “big domino” because they directly calm cortisol and rebalance nightly hormones. Even with your 7–8 hours of sleep, those 2–3 night wakings and more than three drinks per week keep your nervous system in alert mode. When you anchor your bedtime and protect deep sleep, you restore the rhythm that tells hair follicles to pause shedding and prepare for regrowth.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower nightly cortisol:</strong> reduces the stress signal that prolongs shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm repair:</strong> aligns melatonin and estrogen patterns that support follicle stability</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Deep restoration:</strong> triggers growth hormone release that fuels scalp recovery</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Stronger sleep cycles:</strong> fewer night wakings mean steadier stress resilience by day</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each time you protect your bedtime and wind down gently, you’re teaching your body safety again — and that’s the first step toward calmer shedding and visible regrowth ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
