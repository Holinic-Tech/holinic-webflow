By anchoring your internal clock, your body produces hormones in smoother rhythms that directly calm shedding and support stronger regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, during the peak phase of perimenopausal shedding, your body’s hormonal signals fluctuate daily. Because you’re averaging only 5–6 hours of sleep and wake a few times nightly, resetting your sleep rhythm is your “big domino.” Consistent sleep time helps lower nighttime stress hormones, paving the way toward the stabilization period forecasted for mid‑2025—when shedding steadies and baby hairs can reappear.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick your target sleep window tonight (e.g., 11 p.m.–6 a.m.)—and write it down somewhere visible.</li>\n<li>Each evening, begin preparing for bed so you’re lying down within 30 minutes of that target, even on weekends.</li>\n<li>Set your alarm for the same wake time daily. Morning light exposure soon after waking strengthens your new rhythm.</li>\n<li>If you wake in the night, keep lights dim and avoid checking the clock—just focus on slow, deep breaths until you drift again.</li>\n<li>Give yourself grace: consistency beats perfection. One skipped night doesn’t undo your progress.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll start falling asleep faster, waking with steadier energy, and noticing slightly calmer shedding by week 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Emotional eating late at night can nudge your bedtime later. If you crave snacks, choose a small protein bite earlier in the evening instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—every aligned bedtime quietly rewires your hormones toward balance. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Wind Down Protocol helps you quiet both mind and body before bed so you drift into deeper, steadier sleep. The goal is not perfection—just creating a nightly rhythm that tells your system, “It’s safe to rest now.”</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, Mimi, you’re in the peak phase—your body’s stress and perimenopausal shifts are still stirring, and short, broken sleep keeps hormones from recalibrating. A steady wind‑down is your big domino: it eases nighttime wake‑ups and supports calmer shedding as your body moves toward the stabilization window in mid‑2025. Each restful night lays groundwork for regrowth later in the year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a nightly “slow down” alarm.</strong> Choose a time about 45 minutes before bed. When it rings, mark the start of your off‑duty mode.</li>\n  <li><strong>Dim lights + disconnect.</strong> Switch overhead lights to lamps; silence news or messaging apps. Gentle light cues your brain toward melatonin release.</li>\n  <li><strong>Body signal routine.</strong> Wash face, brush teeth, stretch shoulders or neck. Doing these in the same order each night teaches your body the pattern of rest.</li>\n  <li><strong>Jot & release.</strong> Spend five minutes writing stray thoughts or to‑do’s. Close the notebook when done—this stops mental replay later.</li>\n  <li><strong>Smooth transition.</strong> Play soft instrumental audio or breathe out for twice as long as you inhale for two minutes in bed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep within 20–30 minutes, waking fewer than twice per night, or feeling less morning grogginess within a week.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Caffeine after 3 p.m. can still buzz at bedtime—slide it earlier by one hour each week until it’s before lunch.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each evening you honor your wind‑down, your scalp and hormones edge closer to calm. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Caffeine Cut Off helps you still enjoy your coffee while protecting your sleep—by learning when to draw the line so your body can truly rest and your hormones can steady overnight.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, since you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of shedding and often have caffeine after 3 pm, your sleep rhythm is taking a quiet hit that keeps stress hormones high into the night. This simple fence—ending caffeine earlier—can calm that cycle and move you toward stabilization faster. Think of it as freeing your body to do its nightly repair work that directly supports new growth later this year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick your personal caffeine deadline—start with noon and hold it steady for the next 7 days.</li>\n<li>Still crave a warm drink after lunch? Swap to decaf or herbal options like rooibos or barley tea.</li>\n<li>If you slip and have coffee late, drink extra water and keep your bedtime screen‑free to shorten its impact.</li>\n<li>Once the noon cut‑off feels easy, notice if your sleep length or depth improves—then keep it as your new normal.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep faster, wake up fewer times, and feel less wired at night within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late‑day energy dips can tempt another cup—eat a protein snack (like a boiled egg or nuts) instead to lift you naturally.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each earlier cup helps your body trust its rhythm again. One steady day at a time, Mimi. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Caffeine Cut Off","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Calming the Peak Phase by Resetting Your Sleep Rhythm 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Mimi, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of shedding, when perimenopausal changes are still active and your body hasn’t yet received the “all clear” signal to slow hair fall. Because your <strong>main trigger is ongoing hormonal fluctuation</strong>, the fastest way to steady shedding is to calm your internal stress rhythm — and that begins with sleep consistency.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your nights are short (5–6 hours) and often broken, with caffeine lingering after 3 pm. This week’s practices — locking in a consistent bedtime, creating a simple wind‑down, and setting a caffeine cut‑off — are small but powerful levers. Deep, predictable sleep lowers evening cortisol and helps your ovaries and adrenal glands communicate more clearly. That steadier hormone conversation quiets the “danger” signal hair follicles respond to, allowing them to stay anchored longer.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> lowers stress hormones that extend the shedding phase</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormone balance:</strong> steadier sleep‑wake timing helps smooth perimenopausal swings</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Boosts follicle recovery:</strong> deeper sleep increases growth‑phase signals to hair roots</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Improves energy and mood:</strong> better rest reduces emotional eating and stabilizes daily stress</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your bedtime and skip that late coffee, you teach your body it’s safe to restore — and your follicles begin to listen 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
