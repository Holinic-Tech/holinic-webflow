Because you wake 2–3 times a night and sleep only 6–7 hours, nerves and hormones stay more “switched on” than your follicles like. A gentle wind down is your big domino—it trains your body to switch gears nightly, moving you toward steadier sleep and setting the stage for regrowth once your health flare settles.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose a 20–30 minute buffer before bed where you put screens away (phone, laptop, TV).</li>\n    <li>Dim lights or switch to a soft lamp to signal to your brain that the day is closing.</li>\n    <li>Pick one calming cue: light stretch, deep breathing, or short meditation (5–10 minutes).</li>\n    <li>Write down tomorrow’s top 3 tasks on paper to quiet looping thoughts.</li>\n    <li>Slip into bed with no rush—your body will start associating this routine with deeper rest.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling sleepy faster instead of wired at bedtime; fewer middle-of-the-night wake ups; less grogginess in the morning.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late caffeine is still creeping into your evenings—swap afternoon coffee for water or herbal tea to avoid sabotaging your wind down.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—one calm night at a time, you’re teaching your body how to truly rest. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Caffeine Cut Off simply means setting a latest time in the day to enjoy coffee or tea, so the stimulant doesn’t linger into the night and disturb your sleep cycle.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase, where calming your system is key after months of active shedding. Right now, two things can quietly hold you back: waking 2–3 times a night and having caffeine after 3 pm. Even small sleep disruptions keep stress hormones elevated and delay follicle recovery.

This is the moment where your daily rhythms can either reinforce stress signals or gently tell your follicles, “it’s safe to hold on.” Because your chronic condition is still active, creating consistency in sleep and stress recovery becomes the lever that makes the biggest difference right now.</p>\n  <p>Here’s why this week’s practices matter: your 6–7 hours of broken sleep, late caffeine, and 2–3 night wakings keep cortisol and adrenaline elevated. That repeated stress loop tells follicles to stay in “shedding mode.” By anchoring a regular bedtime, winding down instead of pushing through, and keeping caffeine earlier in the day, you calm those stress messengers, restore natural hormone rhythms, and allow growth signals to return overnight. Deep sleep is when growth hormone pulses, repairing tissue and fueling hair cell activity — and these practices help you access more of it.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer stress hormones:</strong> lowers cortisol spikes that prolong shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal rhythm reset:</strong> steadier sleep/wake cues that support scalp balance</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Better follicle recovery:</strong> growth hormone release during deep sleep nourishes hair cells</li>\n    <li>☕ <strong>Smart caffeine timing:</strong> enjoy coffee without it stealing your restorative rest</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your sleep anchor and protect your deep rest, you build the foundation for shedding to calm and baby hairs to push through stronger 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
