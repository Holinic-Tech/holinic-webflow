With long-term stress still active and only 5–6 hours of sleep most nights, winding down intentionally before bed is your “big domino.” It calms the hormonal stress loop that has kept follicles on alert and helps move your scalp from fragile recovery toward steady regrowth by spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a 20‑minute buffer:</strong> Choose a consistent time each night to disconnect from screens and obligations — even if you work late. This becomes your signal that the outside world can wait.</li>\n<li><strong>Release the day:</strong> Sit somewhere quiet, place one hand over your chest, and take three slow breaths in through your nose and out through your mouth. Let your shoulders drop with each exhale.</li>\n<li><strong>Write a “parking note”:</strong> Jot tomorrow’s to‑dos or lingering worries on paper. Getting them out of your head prevents nighttime rumination.</li>\n<li><strong>Add one sensory cue:</strong> Dim the lights, stretch gently, sip chamomile or warm water with lemon — anything that feels soothing and tells your body, “We’re safe now.”</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it consistent:</strong> Repeat this exact sequence nightly for two weeks to anchor your nervous system’s rhythm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up feeling less wired, falling asleep within 15–20 minutes, and occasionally sleeping a full stretch without waking.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you find yourself scrolling or checking messages right before bed, that re‑activates stress chemistry. Quick fix — leave your phone charging outside the room during your wind‑down window.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about treating rest like a skill you can master — giving your body a nightly chance to recalibrate hormones and calm stress so new hairs sustain their growth.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Aidee, you’re in the stabilization phase: shedding still fluctuates, but baby hairs are appearing. Because chronic stress remains active and you often sleep less than six hours due to schedule demands, this practice is your big domino. Restoring deep, consistent sleep now helps your nervous system shift from high alert into repair mode, keeping those fresh hairs anchored and preparing you for steady regrowth by spring.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your wake anchor.</strong> Choose one wake time you can keep seven days a week, even on rest days. This locks your body clock and improves sleep pressure at night.</li>\n<li><strong>Morning light within 60 minutes.</strong> Step outside or stand by a bright window for 5–10 minutes right after waking; it signals “daytime” to your brain and reduces late‑night cortisol surges.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your first 90 minutes after waking.</strong> Delay stress inputs — no emails or doom‑scrolling until coffee and daylight have done their work. This single change steadies your stress rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Reserve your last 90 minutes before bed for winding down.</strong> Keep light levels low and do calm preparation for sleep (gentle stretch, journaling, reading).</li>\n<li><strong>Track recovery cues.</strong> Note mornings when you wake refreshed or your scalp feels less tender — small indicators your system is recalibrating.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer mid‑night wakeups, and mornings that feel clearer even on short nights.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑evening screen time can rob your deep rest; fix it by dimming devices or using audio stories after 9 pm.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds recovery — and each stable night strengthens the foundation for calmer shedding ahead. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reclaim Calm and Signal Safety to Your Hair 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Aidee, you’re in the stabilization phase — the most important bridge between shedding and regrowth. Because your chronic stress is still ongoing, this week is about calming your body’s internal “alert system” through consistent, restorative sleep. The goal isn’t perfection; it’s rhythm. With your current 5–6 hours of rest and an irregular schedule from shift work, setting a steady bedtime will start telling your body it’s safe to conserve and rebuild.</p>\n  <p>When sleep becomes predictable, cortisol drops and your nervous system stops sending “danger” signals to the scalp. Growth hormones rise during deep sleep, fueling repair inside follicles that have been stuck in survival mode. These practices—anchoring your bedtime, winding down gradually, and learning to “sleep like a pro”—are the big domino that steadies stress chemistry and prepares the ground for regrowth predicted to strengthen through spring.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower cortisol spikes:</strong> reduces the stress feedback that keeps follicles cycling out too soon</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balanced hormones:</strong> steadier daily rhythms support thyroid and reproductive balance for stronger strands</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deep sleep allows stem cells in the root to repair and re‑enter growth phase</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Energy renewal:</strong> better rest sharpens mood and resilience, making healthy routines easier to keep</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your sleep window, you’re teaching your body that the storm has passed—and inviting steadier strands and new baby hairs to follow 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
