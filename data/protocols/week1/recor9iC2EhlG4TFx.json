With your stress levels still running high and sleep broken 2–3 times a night, this practice becomes your big domino. Each smooth, consistent wind-down night steadies your nervous system — the foundation your follicles need before regrowth begins in early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose a cue:</strong> Pick one small action that starts your slowdown — dim the lights, brush your teeth, or switch your phone to airplane mode about 45 minutes before bed.</li>\n  <li><strong>30‑minute calm zone:</strong> During this window, do something repetitive and low‑stimulation: gentle stretching, reading a paper book, or mindful journaling. Let the mind settle — no screens or news.</li>\n  <li><strong>Body signal:</strong> Take a slow breath in for 4 seconds, exhale for 6. Do five rounds. This cues safety to your nervous system, lowering nighttime cortisol.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anchor it:</strong> Keep the sequence in the same order nightly so your brain learns, “this means rest.” Consistency matters more than perfection.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, one fewer middle‑of‑the‑night wakeup, or waking with clearer focus within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Scrolling after your calm zone will spike alertness again; if you catch yourself, simply set the phone in another room and re‑start your breath sequence.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The <strong>Professional Sleeper</strong> practice helps you train your body to get deeper, more restorative rest. It’s about designing your nights so your brain, hormones, and hair all get to reset and rebuild properly.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>You’re in the <em>stabilization</em> phase, Devy — the storm has passed, but stress is still nudging your system to stay on high alert. Because you wake 2–3 times each night and sleep around 6–7 hours, the quality of your rest is what’s blocking regrowth from starting. Building strong sleep rhythms now is your “big domino” — it calms your stress hormones so shedding can finally quiet down before early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Light cue first:</strong> Within 15 minutes of waking, step outside or face a bright window for 5–10 minutes. This locks in your body’s circadian clock for the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Temperature cue second:</strong> Drop your bedroom temperature a few degrees below daytime levels each evening. Your core body temp falling signals it’s time to rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Sound + dark:</strong> Use a fan, white noise, or a playlist of consistent sounds to mask wake-ups. Keep the room fully dark; even tiny light leaks can restart alertness hormones.</li>\n<li><strong>Morning anchor:</strong> Wake at roughly the same time daily (within 30 minutes, even weekends). This consistency teaches your brain when to release sleep and energy hormones naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Reset after wake-ups:</strong> When you do wake at night, avoid checking the clock. Take a slow inhale for 4 counts, exhale for 6, repeat until your heart rate settles.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling sleepier at a consistent time within a week, fewer night wakings, easier mornings without grogginess.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-night exercise or screen scrolling can sneak in adrenaline; instead finish workouts ≥2 h before bed and switch screens to warm/dim mode after 9 pm.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one deeply restful night at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Your Reset Week: Calming Stress and Signaling Safety to Your System 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Devy, you’re in the stabilization phase — the worst of the shedding wave from last fall is behind you, but your body still needs a clear signal that it’s safe to shift gears. Because your chronic stress is ongoing, this week’s focus on consistent sleep timing and winding down is the “big domino” that helps your system finally exhale and stop sending stress signals to your follicles.</p>\n  <p>When sleep becomes predictable, cortisol levels flatten, your nervous system relaxes, and nighttime repair hormones like growth hormone can do their job. With your current 6–7 hours of sleep and two to three night wakings, anchoring a steady bedtime and gentle wind-down routine will calm the loop that keeps shedding active. These simple habits rebuild the foundation your hair needs before regrowth begins in the next cycle.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets your stress response:</strong> lowers nightly cortisol so follicles can exit “alert” mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances hormones naturally:</strong> supports thyroid and estrogen rhythms tied to hair growth</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Restores repair signals:</strong> deeper sleep boosts growth hormone and scalp circulation</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Builds stress resilience:</strong> steadier rest makes daily triggers less disruptive</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your bedtime, you teach your body safety again — and every calmer morning brings you closer to steady shedding and those first baby hairs 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
