{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Consistent Sleep Timing means going to bed and waking up at roughly the same hour each day — ideally within a 30‑minute window. It trains your body to expect rest, so your hormones, stress response, and hair growth cycle can find their rhythm again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, your high stress and long‑term shift‑work pattern are keeping your body in “alert” mode, even while you sleep. At this stabilization stage, syncing your sleep clock is your big domino — it calms the stress signals that still delay regrowth. Once your rhythm steadies, follicle recovery can begin in earnest.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick one bedtime you can keep seven days a week — for example, 11:00 pm — and commit to being in bed within 30 minutes of it.</li>\n<li>Set a gentle reminder 45 minutes before bed to signal “wind‑down mode,” finishing screens, chores, and bright lights.</li>\n<li>Keep your wake‑up time consistent too, even on weekends; shift days throw off hormone balance more than late nights.</li>\n<li>If your shift schedule changes, anchor at least two consecutive days per week to the same sleep window to re‑sync.</li>\n<li>Use morning light (a short walk or open window) to reinforce your body clock and help cortisol lower naturally later in the day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling calmer around bedtime, fewer mid‑night wakeups, and less morning grogginess within the first 10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> You often push past tiredness to “get one more thing done” after work — pause when you first feel your energy dip, and start your bedtime cue then.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — each aligned night signals safety to your body, and your hair will follow that sense of calm. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you ease your nervous system before bed so your body can fully shift from “go” mode to “repair” mode. It’s a gentle nightly ritual that signals safety and steadiness—conditions your follicles rely on to thicken and regrow.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, you’re in the stabilization phase, where your follicles can still recover—but your high stress and limited sleep hours are quietly extending each shedding wave. This practice is your big domino: calming your evening stress cues lets your thyroid and perimenopausal hormones regulate overnight, giving your body the rest window it needs to move toward regrowth. Think of it as your personal switch from surviving to replenishing.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a nightly “slow down” alarm</strong> 45 minutes before bed. When it chimes, stop all demanding tasks or screens.</li>\n  <li><strong>Light cue:</strong> dim household lights and turn on a single warm lamp to tell your brain “night has arrived.”</li>\n  <li><strong>Body cue:</strong> do 3–5 minutes of gentle stretches or slow breathing—exhale longer than you inhale.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mind cue:</strong> write down tomorrow’s top 3 priorities to clear mental clutter, then note one small gratitude from today.</li>\n  <li><strong>Transition:</strong> wash your face or brush teeth slowly, focusing on the sensations rather than the clock. Then head straight to bed.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> falling asleep faster within a week, fewer middle‑of‑the‑night wake‑ups, and waking with steadier morning energy.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> finishing work emails or scrolling news after your “slow down” alarm—swap phone time for soft music or stretching instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—one restful night at a time. 🌙 Your calmer evenings today will quietly lay the groundwork for thicker roots tomorrow. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you train your body to get truly restorative rest — the kind that rebuilds hormones and scalp health while you sleep. It’s about working with your biology so your nights become your strongest recovery time.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, you’re in the stabilization phase — loss still comes in waves, which tells me your stress hormones are dipping but not settled yet. Because you sleep under six hours and do shift work, your body can’t fully reset overnight. This practice is your big domino: once your sleep becomes deeper and more predictable, stress chemistry steadies and regrowth can start to push through.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Dark cue:</strong> Within an hour of your intended sleep “anchor,” dim lights and avoid overhead brightness. Your brain needs a strong darkness signal every night.</li>\n  <li><strong>Temperature cue:</strong> Aim for a cooler room (18–20°C). Even a small drop tells your body it’s time to produce melatonin and growth hormones.</li>\n  <li><strong>Morning light + movement:</strong> Within 60 minutes of waking, get outside light in your eyes for 5–10 minutes. This locks your body clock so sleep pressure builds naturally later.</li>\n  <li><strong>Consistent anchor:</strong> Keep your wake-up time within 30 mins seven days a week, even on days off. It’s your main rhythm setter.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protect the first sleep cycle:</strong> The first 90 minutes after you fall asleep is prime restoration time—avoid interruptions if possible.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You wake feeling more refreshed, daily tension or anxiety drops by midday, and evening yawns come at a predictable time within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-night phone scrolling—blue light tells your brain it’s daytime. Quick fix: charge your phone outside the bedroom or use a red filter mode after 9 p.m.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each steady night brings your follicles closer to calm recovery. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑teaching Your Body That It’s Safe to Pause and Repair 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Ana, you’re in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — shedding still comes in waves, but your follicles are ready to recover once your system feels steady again.

Consistency here is the “big domino” that helps every other part of your recovery fall into place.</p>\n  <p>When you sleep deeply and at a regular time, cortisol levels drop, thyroid and estrogen activity rebalance, and your follicles can move out of shed mode. With your current 5–6 hours of rest and shift‑work schedule, anchoring a set bedtime and gentle wind‑down tells your body: “the threat is over.” These nightly cues retrain your stress system and open the door for regrowth to begin.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower cortisol surges:</strong> reduces the “alarm” signals that keep follicles stuck in resting phase</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm repair:</strong> steadier sleep‑wake timing supports thyroid and perimenopausal balance</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper recovery sleep:</strong> boosts growth hormone and cell repair overnight</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Foundation for regrowth:</strong> creates the calm internal state follicles need to restart growth cycles</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each time you honor your sleep window this week, you’re signalling safety to your body — one peaceful night closer to calmer shedding and the return of new baby hairs 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
