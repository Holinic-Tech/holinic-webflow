{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Consistent Sleep Timing means going to bed and waking up within the same 30‑minute window every day, even on weekends. It helps your body know exactly when to rest and restore so your stress hormones fall into rhythm again.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Right now you’re in the peak phase, Heather — when shedding is at its heaviest and recovery feels far away. Because perimenopause and your rapid weight‑loss plan both unsettle hormonal timing, anchoring your sleep becomes your “big domino.” This steadiness signals safety to your body, easing the stress messengers that keep follicles in shedding mode. Consistency now shortens your path toward the stabilization window later this spring. 🌙</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Pick your anchor time:</strong> Choose the bedtime that best fits your natural rhythm — one you can keep within 30 minutes nightly (for example, 10:30 pm ± 30 min).</li>\n    <li><strong>Set your wake window:</strong> Count back 7–8 hours and stick to that same wake‑up range even on weekends.</li>\n    <li><strong>Create mini cues:</strong> Schedule gentle signals — dim lights, brush teeth, or read a few pages — so your mind links them with “sleep approaching.”</li>\n    <li><strong>Protect the first two weeks:</strong> If you’re tempted to stay up later, remind yourself this two‑week window is retraining your internal clock; treat it like a short‑term experiment.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling drowsy at the same time each night, fewer middle‑of‑the‑night awakenings, and slightly calmer mornings within 10 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Scrolling your phone after lights‑out keeps your brain alert; charge your phone across the room to fix this fast.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one smooth bedtime at a time. Every night you anchor your sleep, you’re telling your body, “You’re safe to grow again.” 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you shift your body from “go mode” to “restore mode” every evening, so sleep can do its quiet repair work—calming stress signals and supporting steady hair growth rhythms.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, you’re in the peak-shedding stage, Heather—when both perimenopausal hormone changes and recent calorie restriction can make your system feel wired yet depleted. Consistently winding down before bed is your big domino: it steadies cortisol, restores nightly repair, and guides you toward the stabilization window that opens around April. The calmer your nights, the sooner your shedding will ease and growth can restart.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a nightly signal:</strong> Choose a cue—dimming lights, lighting a candle, or turning off bright screens—that tells your body “the day is closing.” Start about 45 minutes before bed.</li>\n  <li><strong>Transition activity:</strong> Pick a quiet 10–15 min ritual such as reading light pages, light stretching, or slow breathing. Keep it the same each night to train your nervous system.</li>\n  <li><strong>Buffer worries:</strong> Keep a small “brain-dump” notebook by your bed. Write tasks or thoughts, close it, and physically set it aside. This mentally bookmarks them for morning.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hydrate smartly:</strong> Sip a small glass of water early in the wind‑down window instead of right before bed to reduce nighttime waking.</li>\n  <li><strong>Lights out, gratitude in:</strong> When you lie down, bring one gentle appreciation from the day—it signals safety and helps you drift off naturally.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep within 20–30 minutes more easily, wake fewer than two times nightly, and feel clearer on waking within a week or two.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Checking your phone during that last hour spikes alertness. If it’s hard to resist, leave it charging outside the bedroom and use a simple alarm clock.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—one settled evening leads to steadier hormones, steadier sleep, and eventually, steadier shedding. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about restoring the skill of truly restorative rest — deep, unbroken sleep that lets your body reset hormonal rhythms and nutrient use so hair growth can resume naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of shedding, when both perimenopausal changes and calorie restriction are stressing your system. Improving sleep quality is your “big domino”: it steadies cortisol and helps your follicles re‑enter growth mode sooner. Each week of stronger, more consolidated rest moves you closer to stabilization — and toward the regrowth window forecasted for early fall 2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a wind‑down cue:</strong> Choose one calming signal for your body — dim lights or soft music — beginning roughly 60 min before bed.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep your morning light routine sacred:</strong> Within 30 min of waking, get 5–10 min of daylight exposure outdoors to anchor circadian timing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optimize your sleep cave:</strong> Keep temperature slightly cool (65–68 °F / 18–20 °C) and remove or dim any light sources.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protect the early‑night hours:</strong> If you wake 2–3 times, experiment with a slightly earlier bedtime and deep belly breathing instead of screens when awake.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track patterns, not perfection:</strong> Note how long you stay asleep before first waking — this is your key improvement metric over the next two weeks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer mid‑night wake‑ups, and waking with steadier morning energy within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Scrolling social media when you can’t sleep keeps cortisol high; swap it for slow breathing or gentle stretches to calm your system.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — every restful night helps your scalp and cycles recover, one peaceful breath at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reclaim Calm to Halt the Peak Shedding Wave</h4>\n  <p>Heather, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of shedding — that stretch where it looks like your hair is falling faster than it can possibly recover. Because your <strong>perimenopausal changes and rapid weight loss</strong> are still ongoing, your body is under extra pressure to find balance. This week is about giving it that signal of safety by stabilizing your nervous system through sleep consistency.</p>\n  <p>When bedtime shifts by 30–60 minutes and you wake up a few times each night, your cortisol rhythm never truly resets. These practices — consistent sleep timing, a gentle wind‑down, and learning to become a “professional sleeper” — are the big dominoes that calm the stress loop driving excess shedding. Deep, predictable rest lowers cortisol, steadies estrogen fluctuations, and allows follicles to exit the “panic” phase and re‑enter recovery mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> aligns your body clock, easing the stress signal that prolongs shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> supports smoother perimenopausal shifts and nutrient absorption</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Restorative sleep cycles:</strong> boost growth hormone that fuels follicle repair</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Recovery foundation:</strong> sets the stage for stabilization by spring and visible regrowth later in the year</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your set bedtime, you tell your body it’s safe to stop shedding — and you move one step closer to calm, steady growth ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
