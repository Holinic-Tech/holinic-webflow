When your body knows exactly when to rest, your internal clock syncs, helping hormones and repair signals flow smoothly to your scalp overnight.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Solveig, you’re entering your regrowth phase—shedding has steadied and those new baby hairs confirm recovery has begun. Because chronic stress and long-term hormonal treatment have been ongoing, anchoring your sleep schedule is the lever that steadies hormone rhythm and cortisol balance. This one rhythm will help those fragile new hairs root deeply and transition into stronger strands over the next few months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a target bedtime you can maintain even on weekends—ideally when you naturally feel drowsy (for most, between 10–11 p.m.).</li>\n<li>Set your wake-up time 7–8 hours later and mark both in your phone calendar as repeating events.</li>\n<li>Begin the nightly countdown: 30 minutes before bed, dim lights and finish any planning for tomorrow so your mind starts powering down.</li>\n<li>If something delays you, still settle within 30 minutes of your set time—consistency matters more than perfection.</li>\n<li>After one week, note how often you hit your window; aim for at least 5 of 7 nights before tightening further.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a few days; waking up clearer and calmer; noticing steadier shedding during washing or brushing.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> It’s easy to stretch bedtime while reading or scrolling—set a simple “lights out” alarm to keep momentum.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each aligned night tells your body, “It’s safe to repair now.” Keep stacking those restful hours, one evening at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently shift your body and mind from “go‑mode” into rest, so you fall asleep more easily and your stress hormones settle before bed.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Solveig, you’re entering the regrowth‑start phase — a hopeful stage where your shedding has steadied and soft new hairs are beginning to show. Ongoing stress has been your main sustaining trigger, and this nightly wind‑down is your big domino: it trains your body to switch off that long‑term stress loop, letting growth signals take the lead and helping fragile new strands strengthen week by week.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your transition alarm.</strong> One hour before bed, set a gentle reminder to start your wind‑down — lights dim, tasks wrapped up.</li>\n<li><strong>Do a calm body reset.</strong> Spend 5–7 minutes stretching or lying on the floor, breathing slowly into your belly. Let your shoulders drop.</li>\n<li><strong>Write a release list.</strong> Jot down thoughts or unfinished tasks to handle tomorrow. Getting them out frees your mind from looping.</li>\n<li><strong>Switch to low‑stim pleasure.</strong> Read, journal, or listen to instrumental music with warm lighting — no screens or news scrolls.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your phone outside the bedroom.</strong> If needed for alarms, set it to airplane mode across the room.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep within 15 minutes, fewer night wakings, and a morning sense of calm focus rather than rush.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late scrolling — even 15 minutes of blue‑light news can kick stress back on. Quick fix: plug your phone to charge in another room once the alarm chimes.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one peaceful evening at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is all about raising the quality of the hours you already sleep—training your body to reach deeper, more restorative rest so it can quietly reset hormones, calm inflammation, and keep follicles steady overnight.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Solveig, you’ve finally entered your regrowth-start phase—shedding has calmed and baby hairs are surfacing. Now your main task is helping each night’s sleep nourish recovery after years of stress and hormonal juggling. Deep sleep is your “big domino”: when it clicks, cortisol steadies, and your scalp environment stays balanced so those new wisps can strengthen into real strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Expose your eyes to natural light within 30 minutes of waking (step outside or face a window)—this sets your internal clock for sounder sleep later.</li>\n<li>Keep your bedroom pitch-dark and cool (around 18–19 °C); layer a blanket if needed instead of raising the thermostat.</li>\n<li>Reserve the bed only for sleep and intimacy—no reading headlines, scrolling, or planning tomorrow once you lie down.</li>\n<li>If thoughts race, try a slow nasal exhale: breathe in for 4 counts, out for 6 —repeat 3 times to nudge your body toward parasympathetic calm.</li>\n<li>Should you wake briefly in the night, stay half‑asleep: don’t reach for your phone. Trust your body to drift back within a few minutes.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> waking up with warmer hands and feet (a sign of deeper rest), feeling naturally sleepy at the same time nightly, and noticing steadier morning energy within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> finishing dinner less than an hour before bed—which you often do—can keep your core temperature too high; aim to end the meal at least two hours before sleep to ease transition.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one genuinely restful night at a time, those baby hairs get the signal to keep growing. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your System for Steady Regrowth 🌱</h4>\n  <p>Solveig, you’ve entered the <em>regrowth start</em> phase — shedding has steadied and those new baby hairs show your follicles are responding.

When your brain settles into predictable sleep cycles, cortisol drops, growth hormones rise, and your scalp’s micro‑circulation improves overnight.
