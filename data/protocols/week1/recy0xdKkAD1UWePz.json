Set reminders an hour before to start winding down naturally.</li>\n  <li>Choose your wake time based on your 7–8 hour average sleep. Keep both within a 30‑minute window each day, even on weekends.</li>\n  <li>Expose your eyes to daylight within 30 minutes of waking — open curtains, step onto your balcony, or simply face the sunrise light.</li>\n  <li>If you miss your target by more than 30 minutes, get up at your usual wake time anyway and reset the next night. This keeps your internal clock trustworthy.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll begin waking closer to your alarm naturally, morning grogginess fades, and evening drowsiness arrives on cue within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> High stress days may tempt you to “get more done” late at night. Instead, jot unfinished thoughts on paper and step away — your body restores best on time.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady bedtime at a time, you’re teaching your stress hormones to stand down and your follicles to feel safe again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently switch off from the day’s mental noise so your body can slip into restorative sleep without fight-or-flight energy lingering.
