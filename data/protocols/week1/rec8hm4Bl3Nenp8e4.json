{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Consistent Sleep Timing means going to bed and waking up within the same 30‑minute window every single day. That rhythm signals your body when to power down and when to restore, so your hair‑supporting hormones and stress response can reset naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Carmen, right now you’re in the <em>peak</em> of shedding — the point when your body is most sensitive to stress and hormonal swings from perimenopause. Locking in a steady sleep schedule is your big domino: it steadies cortisol and boosts repair signals that calm the cycle of loss. This one rhythm helps move you toward stabilization by mid‑2026 and gives your follicles the calm foundation they’re waiting for.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Pick one target bedtime and wake time that fits your natural rhythm (for example, 10:30 pm–6:30 am).</li>\n  <li>Set evening reminders 30 minutes before bed to help you finish chores and dim lights.</li>\n  <li>Keep the same schedule seven days a week — even on weekends or low‑energy days.</li>\n  <li>If you wake during the night (2–3 times is common), simply stay in low light, breathe slowly, and avoid screens until drowsy again.</li>\n  <li>Track your bedtime consistency in a notebook or phone note for seven nights to build awareness and momentum.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll fall asleep faster within a week, wake feeling clearer, and notice your mid‑day tension begin to lighten.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Emotional eating late at night can push bedtime later; plan a calming snack or warm tea right after dinner instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced night at a time, you’re teaching your body safety again. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently slow your mind and body before bed so your nervous system can drop from alert mode into recovery mode. This deeper rest lowers stress hormones that directly influence your hair’s growth signals overnight.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Carmen, you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase—your body’s stress load and hormonal shifts from perimenopause are front‑and‑center. Even though you get enough hours of sleep, those 2–3 nightly wake‑ups keep cortisol high, feeding both stress and shedding. This nightly wind‑down routine is your “big domino”: it helps your system feel safe again so shedding can start easing toward stabilization by early summer. 🌙</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a consistent signal:</strong> Pick one small ritual — like dimming lights or turning off screens — exactly 45 minutes before bed. This cues your body that rest is coming.</li>\n<li><strong>Release tension physically:</strong> Spend 3–5 minutes doing slow shoulder rolls, gentle neck stretches, or lying with one hand on your belly focusing on slow breaths.</li>\n<li><strong>Swap rumination for grounding:</strong> When your mind loops, name one thing you can see, one you can hear, one you can feel. This anchors you in the present and lowers physiological arousal.</li>\n<li><strong>Feed calm, not comfort food:</strong> If emotional eating hits at night, prepare a soothing non‑food cue—a warm herbal tea or journaling what went well today.</li>\n<li><strong>Commit to consistency:</strong> Repeat this same sequence nightly, even on weekends, so your body learns predictability equals safety.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, fewer midnight wake‑ups, and calmer mood on waking.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you scroll on your phone in bed “to unwind,” that blue light may undo the calm. Quick fix: keep the phone charging in another room and use a real alarm clock.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one peaceful evening at a time. You’re teaching your body to exhale, and your hair will follow. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about turning your nights into your most powerful repair window — where hair, hormones, and nerves get a reset without you lifting a finger. It refines how you sleep, not just how long, so your body can finally switch from “fight‑or‑flight” to “rebuild.”</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Carmen, you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase, when shedding feels relentless. With chronic stress, restrictive eating, and perimenopausal shifts all active, your body has been running on alert mode. Deep, efficient sleep is your fastest way to quiet the stress signals driving loss and move toward the stabilization window forecast for spring. This is your “big domino” — the habit that makes every other step easier.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Expose to morning light:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, get 5–10 minutes of natural sunlight. It calibrates your body clock and sets up better night‑time melatonin release.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor your wake time:</strong> Pick a *fixed* rising time (even on weekends). Let bedtime float naturally, but wake within a 30‑minute window daily.</li>\n<li><strong>Reserve the bed for sleep only:</strong> No scrolling, no TV. That mental boundary tells your brain, “this space = rest.”</li>\n<li><strong>Cool and dark environment:</strong> Keep room around 65–68 °F (18–20 °C); blackout curtains or a sleep mask if needed.</li>\n<li><strong>If you wake 2–3 times nightly:</strong> Stay gentle — breathe slowly, stretch fingers and toes, visualize exhaling tension from the scalp. Avoid checking the clock.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice you fall back asleep faster after midnight wake‑ups, feel calmer in the morning, and see slight reduction in daily shedding within two weeks as cortisol steadies.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating close to bedtime can fragment sleep. If cravings hit late, pair chamomile tea with a small protein snack instead of sweets.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one restorative night at a time. 🌙 Your body will catch up to the calm you create.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Creating Calm Inside the Peak Phase 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Carmen, right now you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> of shedding — the storm before things settle.

This week’s focus on stabilizing your sleep rhythm is the fastest way to tell your system it’s safe again.</p>\n  <p>When your sleep becomes predictable, cortisol starts to drop and nighttime repair hormones rise. Even though you’re already getting 7–8 hours, your 2–3 night wakings interrupt the deep sleep that restores your hair cycle. By anchoring a consistent bedtime, adding a gentle wind-down, and practicing the “professional sleeper” steps, you’ll start to rebuild the hormonal and metabolic balance your follicles need to pause shedding.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Reset stress signaling:</strong> steadier sleep lowers cortisol spikes that prolong the shed phase</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Rebuild hormone rhythm:</strong> supports balance between estrogen, progesterone, and thyroid activity during perimenopause</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Enhance follicle recovery:</strong> deeper sleep increases growth hormone and nutrient delivery to the scalp</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Strengthen resilience:</strong> steadier mornings reduce emotional eating and stress relapses</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you’re teaching your body that calm is possible again — and that’s when shedding starts to ease and recovery begins 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
