It helps your body clock feel safe and predictable, so your hair‑growth cycles and stress rhythms can steady themselves naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kinga, you’re in the early regrowth phase — those baby hairs you’ve seen are proof your follicles are waking back up. After months of wave‑like shedding linked to your past low‑iron period, your body now craves steady recovery signals. A fixed sleep rhythm calms residual stress hormones and boosts nightly repair, helping those new sprouts anchor firmly and thicken faster over the next few months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose a target bedtime that lets you get 7 hours minimum — for example, lights out at 11 p.m., wake at 6 a.m.</li>\n<li>Set reminders: a “get ready for bed” cue 45 minutes beforehand and an alarm for wake‑up (yes, even weekends).</li>\n<li>Place your phone on “do not disturb” 15 minutes before bed to signal your brain it’s time to power down.</li>\n<li>Stick to the 30‑minute window: if you’re late one night, still wake close to your set time so the rhythm recalibrates.</li>\n<li>After two weeks, notice morning energy and shedding patterns — your consistency is the quiet reset your scalp needs.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Easier wake‑ups, fewer 2–3 a.m. wake‑throughs, and steadier morning mood within the first 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night phone scrolling can easily stretch bedtime; keep the charger outside the bedroom to stay on track.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one anchored night at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently slow your mind and body before bed, so your nervous system eases into deep, restoring sleep that supports steady hair growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kinga, you’re in the early regrowth phase — the shedding waves are calming, and those baby hairs are proof your follicles are responding. Deep, consistent rest now locks this progress in. Because your sleep includes 2–3 night wakings, this calming routine is your “big domino” — it steadies stress hormones and allows iron‑supported regrowth to take root more quickly.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Choose a 30‑minute “power‑down” window before bed. Set your phone aside and dim the lights — this signals your body that the day is closing.</li>\n  <li>Wrap up any mental clutter: jot tomorrow’s to‑dos on paper, then leave it there. You’re training your brain to release, not rehearse, at night.</li>\n  <li>Add one calming cue: gentle stretching, slow breathing, or reading something light (no screens). Keep it the same each night so it becomes automatic.</li>\n  <li>Finish with stillness — two minutes of slow rhythmic breathing, feeling your face and scalp soften with each exhale.</li>\n  <li>Protect this ritual even on weekends; the power is in continuity, not perfection.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, fewer mid‑night wakings, and waking without that wired‑tired buzz — usually noticeable within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Sneaky scrolling or late news checks can re‑spike stress hormones. Quick fix: leave devices charging outside the bedroom 30 min before bed.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time. 🌙 You’re teaching your body that safety and growth go hand in hand.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about treating rest as your main recovery project — creating the deeper, steadier sleep that lets your follicles repair and grow stronger each night.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kinga, you’re in the early regrowth phase — new hairs have already started showing, but they’re still fragile. Because past low iron likely taxed your system, deep nightly recovery is now your “big domino.” When you master quality sleep, your iron utilization, stress repair, and hair growth signals all stabilize faster, setting the foundation for fuller coverage through winter.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Morning light before 9 a.m.</strong> Get outside for 5–10 min of natural light to anchor your circadian rhythm and help your body know when to release growth-restoring hormones later.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your wake time steady.</strong> Even on weekends, wake within the same 30‑min window. This trains your brain to expect sleep at predictable times, improving sleep depth.</li>\n<li><strong>Move your workouts earlier.</strong> Since you use exercise for stress relief, aim to finish at least 3 h before bed — this lets core temperature drop in time for deeper stages of rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Cool, dark, and phone‑free zone.</strong> Dim lights an hour before bed and keep the room slightly cool (18–20 °C). Small signals like these let your nervous system fully power‑down.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your first 30 min after waking.</strong> Delay screens and caffeine briefly; hydrate and stretch instead. It keeps cortisol’s morning rise smooth — calmer days mean calmer shedding.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up less during the night, feeling noticeably more alert by midday, and seeing slightly reduced morning scalp sensitivity within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If late‑evening scrolling creeps back in, keep your phone charging outside the bedroom — one tiny barrier brings instant calm.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one restful night at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Building the Foundation for Stronger Regrowth 🌱</h4>\n  <p>You’ve moved beyond the shedding peak — with your low iron deficiency now resolved, your follicles are finally ready to rebuild. This week is about stabilizing your internal rhythm so your body can keep that recovery momentum going. Because you’re in the <strong>early regrowth phase</strong>, the goal is to help your system feel consistently “safe” — the signal that lets those baby hairs mature instead of being shed prematurely.</p>\n  <p>Sleep is the quiet architect of repair. With your 6–7 hours of rest and a few night wakings, locking in a steady bedtime and gentle wind‑down routine will smooth out cortisol swings and boost growth hormone pulses that feed new hair cells. These practices are the big domino this week — when your nervous system learns predictability, your scalp follows suit with steadier growth and less fragility.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Restores hormonal balance:</strong> steady sleep timing supports thyroid and estrogen rhythms linked to healthy follicles</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Reduces cortisol surges:</strong> calmer nights help your body stay in regrowth mode instead of stress‑shedding</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deepens recovery sleep:</strong> more time in slow‑wave sleep means stronger repair signals for new hair shafts</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Improves nutrient use:</strong> consistent rest lets iron and protein do their rebuilding work efficiently</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every evening you honor your sleep window, you’re telling your body it’s safe to keep growing — one peaceful night at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
