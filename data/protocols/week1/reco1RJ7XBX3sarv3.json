This steadiness trains your body clock to release energy and repair signals at the right times, helping your scalp and follicles feel “safe” again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re moving through the stabilization phase after a long stretch of hormonal and life stress. Your body wants predictability, yet your new job and 30–60‑minute bedtime drift quietly keep your stress hormones on alert. Locking in consistent sleep timing is your big domino—it calms that background tension so your system can settle and prepare for regrowth by spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your anchor:</strong> Choose the earliest bedtime that still feels realistic most nights. If you usually fall asleep around 11 p.m., anchor to 10:45 p.m.</li>\n<li><strong>Set your rise time:</strong> Count back 7 hours from bedtime to land on your ideal wake time, then keep that fixed—even on weekends.</li>\n<li><strong>Use gentle cues:</strong> Ten minutes before bed, dim lights and silence notifications to signal your body “we’re closing up.”</li>\n<li><strong>Record reality:</strong> For the next seven days, jot down actual sleep and wake times. Gaps over 30 minutes? Notice what pulled you off track.</li>\n<li><strong>Course‑correct kindly:</strong> Adjust the anchor only if it truly doesn’t fit. Consistency matters more than perfection.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You wake up slightly more refreshed within a week; afternoon energy uses fewer snacks; evening restlessness fades.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Stress nibbling or “just one more email” near bed can stretch bedtime. Fix: set a digital pause reminder 20 minutes before your chosen time.</li>\n<li>Consistency turns into self‑trust—your body learns it can rely on you. Keep going, one steady night at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently shift from “doing” mode to “restoring” mode each night, so your body can ease into deeper, more repairing sleep.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re in your stabilization phase—your shedding should soon calm, but true regrowth won’t show until spring. Because your new job and hormonal change both keep your system alert, your nightly wind‑down is your single most powerful lever. It tells your stress and hormone signals that the day is ending, so your body can redirect energy from tension toward repair. This is how you move from holding steady to healing. 🌙</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose a cue:</strong> Pick a consistent “wind‑down start” time about 60 minutes before bed. Set a reminder, like dimming lights or lighting a candle.</li>\n<li><strong>Transition your body:</strong> Do one soothing ritual—gentle stretch, warm shower, or lotion massage—to tell your nervous system it’s safe to rest.</li>\n<li><strong>Switch your mind:</strong> For the next 20–30 minutes, no screens or heavy planning. Try reading, journaling short gratitude notes, or slow breathing (in 4, out 6 counts).</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor bedtime:</strong> Aim to be in bed within an hour window nightly, even on weekends, to train your rhythm while hormones recalibrate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, waking with a calmer heart rate, noticing less compulsive late‑night snacking within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If emotional eating creeps in as your “wind‑down,” replace it with a warm tea ritual or a short journal check‑in—same comfort, less stress feedback.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one peaceful night at a time, your body begins to trust rest again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you upgrade the quality—not just the hours—of your rest. It teaches your body to reach deeper, more restorative sleep cycles so your hormones and scalp recovery can finally synchronize.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re entering stabilization after many months of shedding that came in waves. The lingering stress of a new job and your hormonal shift from July mean your system still craves steady repair time. Deep, efficient sleep is the “big domino” now—it calms stress signals that keep follicles in pause mode and sets the stage for regrowth by spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Morning light chase:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, get 5–10 minutes of natural light outside. This locks your body clock and promotes calm alertness later in the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Movement cue:</strong> Do some light activity before noon—walk, stretch, or climb stairs—to build healthy sleep pressure for the evening.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening dim‑down:</strong> Two hours before bed, reduce ceiling lights and switch screens to warmer tones. Soft lighting signals melatonin to rise.</li>\n<li><strong>Set a “wind‑down finish line”:</strong> Pick a time when all mental work stops (e.g., 9 p.m.). From there, only gentle tasks—skincare, journaling, reading.</li>\n<li><strong>Bedroom cue stack:</strong> Keep your room cool, dark, and phone‑free. A soft blanket scent or white noise helps anchor the sense of safety your nervous system needs to drop into deep sleep.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up feeling less wired, fewer mid‑night awakenings, and steadier energy by late morning.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating right before bed can spike blood sugar and delay deep sleep—try a herbal tea or a few almonds instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, one peaceful night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reclaim Calm: Teaching Your Body It’s Safe Again 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Marilou, you’re now in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — the point where shedding begins to quiet after the hormonal and life upheavals of the past year. Because your <strong>hormonal treatment change</strong> is still ongoing, your system needs steady signals that it’s safe to shift from stress to repair. This week’s sleep-based practices — a consistent bedtime, gentle wind-down, and “professional sleeper” mindset — form the foundation for that reset.</p>\n  <p>When bedtime happens at roughly the same time every night, your brain starts releasing melatonin earlier, cortisol drops predictably, and growth hormones rise during deep sleep. That rhythm doesn't just make you feel rested — it creates the internal stability hair follicles rely on to stay anchored instead of prematurely shedding. With your current 6–7 hours of somewhat variable sleep, this consistency is the fastest lever to calm both your nervous system and your scalp.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower nightly cortisol:</strong> helps stop the “danger” signal that keeps follicles in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone alignment:</strong> supports balance after your contraceptive change</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Growth hormone boost:</strong> fuels repair and prepares the scalp for regrowth next spring</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper rest:</strong> steadies mood and energy, reducing emotional eating and daily stress loops</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your sleep window, you’re showing your body that life is steady again — and that it’s safe to start holding onto every strand 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
