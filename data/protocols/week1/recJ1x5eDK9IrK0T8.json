{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Consistent Sleep Timing means choosing one bedtime and wake‑up time—and keeping them steady every single day. By training your body clock to expect rest at the same hour, your stress hormones and hair‑growth signals can finally find their rhythm again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rochelle, you’re in the stabilization phase—your scalp is beginning to quiet, but chronic stress is still tugging at your roots. Because you average only 5–6 hours of sleep and drift up to an hour off schedule, this simple anchor is your “big domino.” Regular sleep tells your body it’s safe, steady, and ready to shift from stress survival into repair—paving the way for stronger strands as you move toward regrowth this coming season.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your target bedtime.</strong> Pick a realistic hour that allows at least 7 hours in bed. Write it down—this is your nightly promise to yourself.</li>\n<li><strong>Set a gentle cue.</strong> About 45 minutes before that time, dim overhead lights or turn on a softer lamp to signal “wind‑down mode” (no need for a full ritual yet).</li>\n<li><strong>Commit to a 30‑minute window.</strong> Get in bed within half an hour of your target every night—even on weekends. That consistency matters more than perfection.</li>\n<li><strong>Fix your wake time.</strong> Rise at roughly the same time each morning, even if sleep was short, so your body learns the cadence.</li>\n<li><strong>Track for seven nights.</strong> Jot down bedtime, wake time, and how rested you feel. Notice patterns—awareness drives progress.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll start waking before your alarm, feel fewer mid‑day dips, and see scalp tingling ease as cortisol steadies.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> You often push bedtime later scrolling or snacking after stressful days. Quick fix—set an alarm labeled “bedtime voice,” reminding you the most caring thing right now is rest, not one more scroll.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one calm night at a time, your hair will follow that rhythm. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you guide your body out of “go‑mode” so you can slip into true rest. It’s a short, calming routine that signals your stress hormones to quiet down and lets your scalp and follicles recover as you sleep.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rochelle, you’re in the stabilization phase — your body is trying to hold on to those baby hairs that already peeked through. But high daily stress and only 5–6 hours of rest keep your system on alert. This evening reset is your big domino: it will steady cortisol, slow shedding, and make the regrowth that’s due by mid‑2025 actually take root.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set a gentle boundary:</strong> Pick a daily “off” time about 60–90 minutes before bed when work, chores, and screens stop demanding you.</li>\n  <li><strong>Create a low‑light ritual:</strong> Dim lights, silence notifications, and choose one soothing cue — a candle, diffuser, or soft playlist — that tells your nervous system, “we’re done for the day.”</li>\n  <li><strong>Transition your body:</strong> Try a 3‑minute stretch, slow neck rolls, or legs‑up‑the‑wall to release tension from your scalp line down.</li>\n  <li><strong>Write and release:</strong> Jot any looping thoughts or next‑day tasks in a notebook. It moves worries from mind to paper so your body can rest.</li>\n  <li><strong>Anchor with comfort:</strong> Sip warm herbal tea or practice five slow belly breaths before bed — keep this as your nightly cue.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, fewer morning heart‑races, and waking with smoother mood or less scalp tightness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late caffeine after 3 p.m. will undo the calm. Try swapping your afternoon coffee for rooibos or decaf green tea instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm evening at a time, your hair feels that peace too. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Caffeine Cut Off helps you enjoy your coffee without letting it steal from your sleep. By setting a gentle “no‑caffeine‑after” rule, your body and mind calm more easily at night—so growth hormones can do their quiet repair work while you rest.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rochelle, because you’re in the stabilization phase and sleep about five to six hours a night, your system is craving predictable rest to lock in the regrowth already starting. Late‑day coffee (after 3 pm) can keep stress hormones humming through bedtime, quietly slowing recovery. This is your big domino—one small timing tweak that helps your scalp, digestion, and hormones all settle back into balance before the regrowth season truly begins.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick your personal cut‑off: ideally 2 pm (give or take 8 hours before planned sleep).</li>\n<li>Switch afternoon coffee or tea for decaf, herbal tea, or sparkling water with lemon to keep the ritual without the buzz.</li>\n<li>Track energy dips: if you feel a slump, step outside for light or stretch instead of refilling your mug.</li>\n<li>On weekends, keep the same cut‑off so your body clock stays even through Monday.</li>\n<li>After two weeks, notice if falling asleep feels smoother or if morning anxiety fades faster—those are your cues that it’s working.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep faster; morning heaviness eases; you wake with steadier energy instead of caffeine‑dependent spikes.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> A mid‑afternoon craving might tempt you to “just one more cup.” Try stretching or a quick walk instead—movement recharges without undoing your progress.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—every calm evening is another signal to your scalp that it’s safe to grow again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Caffeine Cut Off","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Your Turning Point: Calming the Stress Loop Through Rest 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Rochelle, you’re now in the stabilization phase — the point where your body starts to recover from last year’s heavy shedding. Because your chronic stress is still ongoing, this week’s focus on restoring sleep rhythm is your “big domino.” When your brain learns that it can rest predictably, cortisol levels begin to settle, and your follicles stop getting mixed signals of danger versus repair.</p>\n  <p>With your current 5–6 hours of sleep and bedtime drifting by about an hour, your body hasn’t had enough consistent deep sleep to fully reset hormones or rebuild keratin stores. These practices — setting a steady bedtime, winding down calmly, and cutting caffeine after 3 pm — work together to stabilize your nervous system. That’s what helps your scalp shift from emergency mode into steady regrowth mode over the coming months.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer cortisol curve:</strong> lowers the stress signal that keeps follicles in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal balance:</strong> supports steadier cycles and reduces shedding linked to PMS swings</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Deeper nightly repair:</strong> triggers growth hormone release that nourishes new baby hairs</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Energy restoration:</strong> improves mood and resilience under ongoing stress</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you honor your bedtime and protect your wind-down, you’re telling your body: “it’s safe to regrow.” Keep showing up for that message — calmer shedding and thicker sprouts are on their way 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
