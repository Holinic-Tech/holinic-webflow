It’s about teaching your body when to rest so your sleep becomes steadier and more restorative.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Elena, you’re in the peak shedding phase, and your nights are currently broken by 2–3 wake-ups with only 5–6 hours of rest. With ongoing stress and chronic illness simmering in the background, anchoring your sleep is the single lever that calms your whole system. This is your “big domino” — once your body trusts it can fully recharge at night, shedding can begin shifting toward stabilization and, in time, regrowth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a realistic bedtime and wake-up time that allow at least 7 hours in bed. Write them down.</li>\n    <li>Commit to keeping your bedtime within 30 minutes of that target, even on weekends.</li>\n    <li>Set a gentle alarm not only for waking, but also a “bed signal” 45 minutes before lights out.</li>\n    <li>If you wake in the night, avoid checking your phone — simply breathe slowly until your body drifts back.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Morning grogginess shortens, you notice slightly calmer energy through the day, and nighttime wake-ups feel less jarring within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-night doom scrolling can easily pull you off schedule. Quick fix: park your phone across the room before bed.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady night at a time, you are signaling safety to your body, and your hair will thank you. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Wind Down Protocol is a gentle evening ritual that helps you shift out of stress mode before bed, so your body can slip into deeper, steadier sleep naturally.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Elena, you’re in the peak shedding stage, and your high stress plus broken sleep (5–6 hours with multiple wake‑ups) is keeping your system stuck in “alert mode.” This ritual is your big domino: by calming your nervous system at night, you set the stage for shedding to stabilize and regrowth to begin on time. Think of this as the bridge between where you are now and the steadier months ahead.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose a set 30‑minute “wind‑down window” before bed — protect it like an appointment with yourself.</li>\n    <li>Dim lights and put your phone on airplane mode; trade doom scrolling for soft background music or an audiobook chapter.</li>\n    <li>Do one “signal” activity: light stretching, journaling, or a warm shower — it tells your brain, “sleep is next.”</li>\n    <li>Keep the ritual consistent (same order each night) so your body learns to follow the cues automatically.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep a little faster within a week; waking up one fewer time at night; feeling less wired at bedtime.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> The pull to scroll under stress. Quick fix: leave your phone charging outside the bedroom and keep a notebook nearby for racing thoughts.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Professional Sleeper helps you upgrade the quality of your rest by focusing on small, powerful habits that make your sleep deeper and more restorative — so your body has the quiet hours it needs to repair and regrow.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Elena, you’re in the peak shedding phase — your body is still under pressure from both chronic illness and high emotional stress. With only 5–6 hours of broken sleep, your system never fully resets overnight. This practice is your “big domino”: improving sleep depth now helps calm stress signals, moving you toward stabilization and making it easier for new growth to take root when your body is ready.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Get outside within an hour of waking — 5–10 minutes of natural light without sunglasses helps anchor your body clock.</li>\n    <li>In the afternoon, aim for at least two 5‑minute breaks where you step away from screens and let your eyes rest on distant objects.</li>\n    <li>Lower bright ceiling lights two hours before bed. Use softer lamps or warm light to signal “night” to your brain.</li>\n    <li>Keep your sleep space cool (around 18–20°C/65–68°F), which naturally deepens rest.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep a little faster by the end of the week; fewer 2–3 a.m. wake-ups; feeling slightly clearer within the first hour of waking.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom scrolling at night disrupts the light cues you’re working on. Quick fix: move your phone charger outside the bedroom and keep a paperback nearby instead.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one better night layers onto the next. Every hour of deeper rest is fuel for calmer shedding and future regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper"}}
