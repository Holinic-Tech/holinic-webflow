But because stress is still active, your body needs steady recovery signals. Anchoring your sleep is the “big domino”: it lowers nightly stress load and supports the calm environment your follicles need to shift into sustained regrowth over the coming months.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a realistic bedtime that gives you 7+ hours of sleep (based on your current 6–7 hours, aim to stretch it slightly).</li>\n    <li>Set a “get ready for bed” reminder 45 minutes before this time.</li>\n    <li>Commit to lights out within 30 minutes of your target — even on weekends.</li>\n    <li>If you wake during the night, avoid the clock; simply return to slow breaths until sleep comes back.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice you fall asleep faster, wake up fewer times in the night, and morning grogginess eases within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> You often wake 2–3 times a night — if scrolling or turning on lights is your default, swap it for a no-light breathing reset to avoid re-alerting your brain.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one solid night anchors the next, and each step steadies the ground for new growth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Wind Down Protocol is a simple evening routine that helps quiet your mind and ease your body into rest, so you fall asleep more deeply and wake with stronger energy reserves.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Toby, you’re in stabilization — shedding has steadied and baby hairs are showing, which is a great sign. But ongoing stress plus your 2–3 night wakings keep your body on high alert.

Quick fix: finish your last meal at least 2 hours before bed whenever possible.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — just one calm night helps reset the rhythm for the next.

Because your main trigger, ongoing chronic stress, is still present, this week is all about giving your system strong signals of safety. The most powerful way to do that right now is through sleep.</p>\n  <p>With 6–7 hours of broken rest and 2–3 night wakings, your body hasn’t been getting the deep, consistent sleep it needs to regulate cortisol and repair follicles. By locking in a consistent bedtime, layering in a gentle wind-down, and learning how to “sleep like a pro,” you’ll lower the stress load on your body and create the exact conditions hair needs to stay anchored longer and regrow stronger.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> steadier sleep lowers cortisol, easing the cycle that keeps shedding active</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> consistent rhythms support balanced estrogen and thyroid signals that influence hair growth</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle repair:</strong> deep sleep is when growth hormone restores tissue and fuels new hair cells</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Resilience building:</strong> quality rest makes you less reactive to daily stress, preventing setbacks</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you anchor your sleep and protect those hours, you’re moving closer to calmer shedding and the steady regrowth you’ve been waiting for 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
