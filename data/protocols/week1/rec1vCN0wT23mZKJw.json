Because chronic stress remains your main trigger, this week’s focus is about sending clear signals of safety: through sleep consistency, winding down effectively, and protecting your nights from late caffeine. These are the “big domino” practices that help your system stop running in emergency mode and start preparing for regrowth.</p>\n  <p>Here’s why this matters for you: when you go to bed at different times, wake 2–3 times a night, and sometimes work late shifts, your body struggles to reset cortisol and restore balance. Late afternoon coffee pushes this even further, keeping stress hormones high into the night. By anchoring a steady bedtime, creating a gentle wind‑down, and cutting caffeine earlier, you lower evening cortisol, lift growth hormone during deep sleep, and help your follicles step out of the shed cycle.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> lowers nightly cortisol so hair isn’t constantly signaled to fall.</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal rhythm repair:</strong> steadier sleep/wake timing supports thyroid and reproductive hormone balance.</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deep sleep turns on repair signals that prepare roots for new growth.</li>\n    <li>☕ <strong>Energy without sabotage:</strong> smarter caffeine timing preserves alertness while protecting sleep quality.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you align your sleep and protect it from stress and stimulants, you’re stacking the odds in favor of calmer shedding and laying the foundation for the first baby hairs to return 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
