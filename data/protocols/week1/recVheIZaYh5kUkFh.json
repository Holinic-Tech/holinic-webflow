Right now, your biggest trigger is chronic stress, and the simplest way to calm it daily is through rhythm. Anchoring your sleep steadies cortisol swings and signals to your follicles that safety has returned. Think of this as your body’s reset switch on the path toward visible regrowth by spring. 🌙</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Pick a target bedtime</strong> you can keep seven nights a week—ideally allowing 7–8 hours of sleep.</li>\n    <li><strong>Set a gentle alarm</strong> or reminder one hour before bed to cue winding down (even if you feel fine).</li>\n    <li><strong>Respect the 30‑minute window:</strong> aim to be in bed no later than 30 minutes past your chosen time, even on weekends.</li>\n    <li><strong>Keep wake time stable,</strong> getting light exposure soon after rising to reinforce your internal clock.</li>\n    <li><strong>Track it for one week</strong> on paper or your phone—seeing the pattern builds motivation.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> waking up less tense in your shoulders or jaw, smoother energy during late afternoons, and mornings that feel more predictable within 7–10 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> on high‑stress evenings you may stay “wired” and delay bedtime—if that happens, lower lights and stretch gently for five minutes rather than pushing through another task.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—one synced bedtime at a time. Your calm rhythm is the ground your new growth will root into. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Wind Down Protocol helps you guide your body out of the stress state before bed, so your nervous system releases its grip and your hair can repair overnight.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Maria, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is easing and new baby hairs are already pushing through.
