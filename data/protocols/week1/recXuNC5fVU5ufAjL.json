{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Jeanne, your shedding is still worsening 1–3 months in—right in the “peak shed” window after big stressors (your illness in Feb and grief in Apr). The most powerful lever now is stabilizing your cortisol curve overnight. You already average 8 hours and a steady schedule 🌙—this practice turns that good base into a true regrowth launchpad by locking in your circadian anchors so shedding can plateau faster and baby hairs can finally sprout.</p> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Fix your wake-up time within a 15‑min band every day, even weekends.</li> \n<li>Expose your eyes to natural morning light within 30 minutes of waking.</li> \n<li>Keep your bedroom cool, very dark, and quiet—think cave‑like.</li> \n<li>Eat protein soon after waking to reinforce circadian rhythm and supply hair substrates.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Wake: 7:00 am ±15 minutes (anchor point)</li> \n<li>Bed window: 11:00 pm–11:30 pm → ~8 hours total</li> \n<li>Morning light: 7:00–7:30 am walk or open window</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Pick one wake time that fits both weekdays and weekends—hold it steady.</li> \n<li>Right after waking, step outside (no sunglasses for 5–10 min) to cue circadian rhythm.</li> \n<li>Keep your room ~18–20 °C, black‑out curtains, earplugs if needed.</li> \n<li>Move your last meal slightly earlier (ideally 2 hrs before bed) to free deeper sleep cycles.</li> \n<li>On evenings when stress lingers, do a short stretch or breath practice to prevent cortisol carryover into the night.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because your major illness + grief pushed follicles into telogen, stabilizing sleep signals flattens cortisol surges that keep pushing hairs out.</li> \n<li>Your worst shed is expected now (Sep–Oct, lagging 2–3 months) → regular sleep can shorten the “peak” and move you into stabilization by winter.</li> \n<li>Morning light and a consistent anchor time boost melatonin quality at night → stronger repair signals, better thyroid/progesterone tone, steadier growth environment.</li> \n<li>Protein at breakfast plus iron awareness ensures raw material for regrowth once follicles cycle back.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If bedtime consistently drifts past midnight or meals stay <1 hr before sleep → expect shallower sleep and slower stabilization. Reset wake anchor.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Waking with steadier energy, fewer midday crashes; shedding feels less “stormy” within ~10–14 days.</li> \n<li>And remember ❤️—stabilization often shows up subtly first (less handfuls), then regrowth follows. Trust your anchors.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice2_html":null,"practice3_html":null,"practice1_title":"Practice 1: Professional Sleeper","practice2_title":"Practice 2: ","practice3_title":"Practice 3: "}}
