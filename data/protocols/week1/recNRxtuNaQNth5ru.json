This anchors your internal clock so your body knows exactly when to switch into repair mode each night.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, your hair is entering its regrowth phase — those baby hairs are proof. Yet with only 5–6 hours a night and bedtimes shifting by more than an hour, your hormones and scalp recovery rhythms still feel unsettled. This single anchor habit stabilizes nightly repair signals that menopause can blur, helping your follicles move fully from fragile new growth to thicker strands before spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your anchor times.</strong> Choose a bedtime you can meet most days — say 11 p.m. — and set your wake-up about 7 hours later. Write both on a note by your bed.</li>\n<li><strong>Use a gentle cue.</strong> Set a silent phone reminder or dim the lights 30 minutes before bed to start winding down naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your first and last hours.</strong> Keep them routine—same sequence each night and morning, even on weekends. Treat it as a standing date with your future self.</li>\n<li><strong>Track for one week.</strong> Each morning mark a quick ✅ if you kept within 30 minutes of your target window. Notice how your mornings feel steadier.</li>\n<li><strong>Adjust only if needed.</strong> After a week, shift your chosen bedtime slightly earlier or later to fit real life—but keep that 30‑minute consistency band.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up a bit easier; fewer 2 a.m. wide‑awake spells; steadier energy before noon.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If a late‑night scroll pulls you past lights‑out, place your phone on a charger in another room 15 minutes earlier — your nervous system will thank you.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one anchored night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you ease out of high gear each evening, teaching your body that it’s safe to rest so your sleep cycles — and hair recovery hormones — can settle naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, you’re in your regrowth phase — those new baby hairs are proof it’s working. But with only 5–6 hours of sleep and two to three night wakings, your body still struggles to complete repair cycles. A slow, predictable wind down is your “big domino”: it tells your stress and hormone systems to quiet down, guiding you toward stable rest as your new growth thickens through early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a “close the day” alarm.</strong> One hour before bed, silence notifications and dim lights to cue wind-down time.</li>\n<li><strong>Unplug ritual:</strong> Place your phone face down in another room, or set it on “Do Not Disturb.”</li>\n<li><strong>Body cue:</strong> Spend 5 minutes in gentle stretching or slow breathing — let your chest and scalp soften with each exhale.</li>\n<li><strong>Transition activity:</strong> Journal one calming thought or gratitude. This signals your mind that the day is complete.</li>\n<li><strong>Lights off target:</strong> Aim to be in bed the same hour nightly, even if sleep takes time to come.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, fewer night wakings by day 10, or waking feeling slightly more refreshed even on shorter nights.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Scrolling in bed can undo your new cue routine. Quick fix: keep your charger outside the bedroom and use a low-light clock instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one peaceful night at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper helps you turn rest into a true recovery tool — by mastering the environment, light cues, and small rhythm tweaks that let your body slip into deeper, more restorative sleep naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, you’ve entered your regrowth phase — shedding has eased, and those new baby hairs are proof. But your 5–6 hours of sleep and night wakings still keep stress hormones mildly elevated, which can slow those fragile hairs from thickening. Focusing on this practice now locks in stability during perimenopause, letting your follicles feel consistently “safe” enough to stay in growth mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Get morning light:</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, step outside or stand by a bright window for at least 5 minutes. It anchors your circadian rhythm for better sleep later.</li>\n<li><strong>Protect your evening light:</strong> After sunset, dim overheads and use warm lamps. Avoid bright bathroom mirrors or phone screens right before bed.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep your sleep cave cool and dark:</strong> Aim for 18–20°C with full blackout or an eye mask. Quiet equals depth — consider soft earplugs if noise wakes you.</li>\n<li><strong>Move daylight into your routine:</strong> A brisk 10–15 minute walk or light stretching in daylight hours trains your body clock and steadies hormone timing.</li>\n<li><strong>Stop clock-checking at night:</strong> If you wake, keep lights off and avoid looking at the time. It’s a quick stress-reset that shortens wake periods.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, fewer middle-of-the-night wakings, or waking slightly more refreshed even without longer sleep.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late-evening phone scrolls can undo the light work you’ve done all day — set your phone to “night mode” by 9 p.m. to keep melatonin steady.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one aligned sunrise and nightly darkness at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑anchoring Your Rhythm to Lock In Regrowth 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Bo, you’ve moved into the early regrowth phase — those new baby hairs are proof your follicles are waking back up. Because your main trigger, perimenopause, is still ongoing, your body’s hormone signals need steadiness more than ever. This week’s focus on consistent sleep timing and gentle wind‑down habits is designed to calm the internal “noise” that still tugs at your recovery rhythm.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your 5–6 hours of broken sleep and 2–3 night wakings are quietly keeping cortisol a touch high and growth hormones low. When you anchor bedtime and teach your body to expect rest at the same time each night, cortisol starts to drop earlier in the evening, and growth‑repair hormones rise predictably. That switch tells follicles, “it’s safe to grow again.”</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer cortisol curve:</strong> lowers daily stress load so follicles stay in their growth cycle</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm support:</strong> steadier sleep–wake timing helps even out perimenopausal fluctuations</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Deeper sleep repair:</strong> boosts nighttime cell renewal and scalp circulation</li>\n    <li>💫 <strong>Energy reset:</strong> better rest sharpens mood and motivation for other recovery steps</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your bedtime window, you quiet the stress signals that fuel shedding and create the calm foundation your regrowth needs to strengthen 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
