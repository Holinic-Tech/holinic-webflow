Because your schedule sometimes shifts for night work, setting a firm sleep anchor is the “big domino” that helps calm the chronic stress pattern still nudging your scalp. Consistent timing steadies your cortisol and supports hormone balance, paving the way for stronger regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Pick an anchor bedtime.</strong> Decide a target (for example, 22:30) that fits both workdays and off‑days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protect a 7–8‑hour window.</strong> Count back from your wake time so you never dip below your typical sleep need.</li>\n  <li><strong>Set a “power‑down” reminder.</strong> Thirty minutes before bed, silence notifications and dim lights to cue your body it’s almost time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Handle night‑shift weeks gently.</strong> When shifts change, shift your bedtime in 30‑minute steps every night until you’re back to your anchor.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track consistency, not perfection.</strong> Note how many nights you stay within the 30‑minute range each week—aim for at least 5.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, steadier morning energy, and fewer mid‑night wake‑ups.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Letting screens pull you past bedtime—set an auto‑off or move your phone to another room to guard your anchor.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum, Gry. One aligned bedtime at a time, you’re helping your scalp—and your whole system—remember how stability feels. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you ease gently out of “go‑mode” before bed so your stress chemistry levels out and your body gets the full, restorative sleep it needs for calmer shedding and steadier growth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Right now, you’re in the stabilization phase—your scalp is trying to find its rhythm again after long‑term stress and the hormonal shifts of perimenopause.

Because stress remains your main ongoing trigger, this week’s work is all about showing your system consistency. A steady sleep rhythm, a gentle wind‑down, and smarter caffeine timing are the fastest ways to tell your body, “the threat is over.”</p>\n  <p>When bedtime becomes predictable, cortisol levels drop earlier in the evening and melatonin rises smoothly. That change alone helps your scalp shift out of the stress‑shedding loop. Deep sleep also releases growth hormones that repair follicle cells and restore sensitivity to estrogen signals — a big win during perimenopause. Even with your 7–8 hours of rest, the >60‑minute variation in bedtime and those late coffees quietly keep your system on alert.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower evening cortisol:</strong> calms the stress signal that prolongs shedding waves</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm support:</strong> steadier sleep strengthens estrogen balance for stronger strands</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle repair window:</strong> deep sleep boosts growth hormone and scalp cell renewal</li>\n    <li>☕ <strong>Better caffeine boundaries:</strong> fewer late‑day spikes mean deeper, more restorative rest</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your bedtime and protect your sleep window, you move one quiet step closer to calmer shedding and the first signs of new growth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
