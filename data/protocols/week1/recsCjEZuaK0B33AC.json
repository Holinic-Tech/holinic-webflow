Because you sleep only 5–6 hours and often wake 2–3 times a night, your body hasn’t yet had the chance to reset. Anchoring your bedtime is your “big domino”—it calms stress signals, helping shed rates ease sooner so stabilization can start on time.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a realistic bedtime you can honor 7 nights a week (e.g. 11:00 pm).</li>\n    <li>Set an alarm for “bedtime prep” 30–45 minutes before, so you’re not surprised by the clock.</li>\n    <li>Each night, get into bed and lights off within 30 minutes of your chosen time.</li>\n    <li>If you wake during the night, don’t check the clock—simply breathe slowly and let your body settle back.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling sleepier at the same time each night, fewer middle‑of‑the‑night wake‑ups, and a slight lift in morning energy within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Scrolling your phone in bed can delay sleep; keep the device charging outside your room to avoid temptation.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—one anchored bedtime at a time, you’re laying the ground for calmer shedding and healthier regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n```","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Wind Down Protocol is a simple evening routine that helps your body shift from “go mode” into true rest, so you fall asleep faster and wake feeling more restored.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the peak shedding stage, where stress is keeping your system on high alert and your sleep short and broken. Right now, this practice is your “big domino,” because calming your nervous system before bed lowers stress signals that prolong shedding and nudges your body closer to the stabilization phase and eventual regrowth. Even one calmer night makes tomorrow’s stress easier to carry.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Set a shut‑down signal:</strong> Pick a simple cue (like dimming lights or closing your laptop) about 45 minutes before bed.</li>\n    <li><strong>Gentle release:</strong> Spend 5–10 minutes with light stretching or a warm shower—just enough to tell your muscles the day is over.</li>\n    <li><strong>Brain quiet time:</strong> Write down tomorrow’s to‑dos on paper, so they’re not spinning in your head at night.</li>\n    <li><strong>Calm input only:</strong> Choose one soothing activity—reading, journaling, or listening to calming music—until you feel drowsy.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep more quickly, waking only once instead of several times, or feeling slightly more refreshed in the morning within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Scrolling your phone at bedtime often delays winding down.

Right now, deep rest is your “big domino.” By nudging your body into more consistent, restorative sleep, you quiet down the stress signals driving shedding and set up smoother days that move you closer toward stabilization and visible regrowth.

Because your main trigger is <strong>chronic stress that’s still ongoing</strong>, your body hasn’t yet had the chance to fully settle. This week is about giving your system a sense of safety and rhythm again — and the fastest way to do that is through consistent, restorative sleep.</p>\n  <p>With only 5–6 hours of broken sleep and 2–3 night wakings, your body is running on constant stress signals. When sleep is short or erratic, cortisol stays high and follicles stay “on alert,” which prolongs shedding. The practices this week — choosing a predictable bedtime, adding a gentle wind-down, and deepening sleep quality — are the big domino because they reset your body’s stress hormones, restore nightly repair cycles, and signal to your scalp that it’s safe to move out of loss mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress relief:</strong> lowers cortisol so follicles stop receiving “danger” signals</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone recalibration:</strong> steadier rhythms ease PMS swings and support balanced growth signals</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Repair at night:</strong> deep sleep boosts growth hormone that fuels cell recovery</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Resilience building:</strong> stronger ability to handle daily stress without triggering more loss</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you anchor your sleep, you quiet the stress loop and move one step closer to calmer shedding and the first wave of baby hairs 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
