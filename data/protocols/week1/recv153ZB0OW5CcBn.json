{"week1":{"practice1_html":"```html\n<section class=\"practice\">\n  <div class=\"big-domino\">\n    <p>Jeanne, you’re in the “stable shedding” phase—past the worst but not yet seeing baby hairs. Right now, your 2–3 nightly wake-ups and afternoon coffee keep cortisol elevated into the night. Without deep, continuous sleep, your follicles stay stuck instead of shifting into regrowth. Putting a gentle fence around caffeine is the single lever that helps restore restorative sleep, calm stress, and move you toward the regrowth window. 🌙</p>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"what-to-do\">\n    <h4>What to do</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Enjoy your morning coffee but finish it before 2 pm.</li>\n      <li>Switch to water, herbal tea, or decaf after 2 pm.</li>\n      <li>Pair protein with your first coffee to reduce jitters.</li>\n      <li>Use an evening ritual (stretch, journaling) instead of “pick-me-up” caffeine at 4–5 pm.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"sleep-schedule\">\n    <h4>Your recommended schedule</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Wake: 7:00 am ±15 min (daily anchor)</li>\n      <li>Bed: 11:00 pm (lights down by 10:30 pm)</li>\n      <li>Aim: 7.5–8h in a cool, dark room with no screens 30 min before</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"steps\">\n    <h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4>\n    <ol>\n      <li>Tomorrow, brew your coffee as usual but cut it off by early afternoon.</li>\n      <li>Expect mild habit urges around 4 pm; keep decaf or sparkling water ready.</li>\n      <li>Replace “stress snacks + late coffee” with a protein snack (nuts, yogurt) to steady energy.</li>\n      <li>Use your evening wind-down routine—dim lights, stretch—to replace the lift you used to get from caffeine.</li>\n      <li>Track how many times you wake up; aim for drop from 2–3 to 1 or fewer within two weeks.</li>\n    </ol>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"why-it-works\">\n    <h4>Why this works (for you)</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li>Caffeine after 3 pm lingers in blood at midnight → lighter sleep → less growth signal. Cutting it earlier restores deep sleep so follicles can flip into anagen sooner.</li>\n      <li>Your major emotional stress is still ongoing. Stable sleep buffers cortisol peaks so stress does less damage to hair cycling.</li>\n      <li>Shedding peaked months ago; your follicles are likely waiting for consistent “safe” signals. Better sleep is that stabilizer.</li>\n      <li>Heavy periods raise iron risk. More restful nights improve iron utilization, giving your body a better base for regrowth.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n  <div class=\"watch-outs\">\n    <h4>What to look out for</h4>\n    <ul>\n      <li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Relying on evening coffee or alcohol together → makes sleep more fragmented. If this happens, double down on earlier cut-off and gentle evening alternatives.</li>\n      <li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Falling asleep faster; fewer 2–3 am wake-ups; steadier morning energy within 7–14 days.</li>\n      <li>Be patient with yourself—choosing water instead of a late coffee is not “giving something up,” it’s creating room for hair to regrow. ❤️</li>\n    </ul>\n  </div>\n</section>\n```","practice2_html":null,"practice3_html":null,"practice1_title":"Practice 1: Caffeine Cut Off","practice2_title":"Practice 2: ","practice3_title":"Practice 3: "}}
