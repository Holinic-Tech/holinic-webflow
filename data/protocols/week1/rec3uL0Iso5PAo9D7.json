{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Consistent Sleep Timing means choosing a regular bedtime and waking up within the same 30‑minute window every day, even on weekends. It anchors your body clock so your sleep becomes deeper and more restorative.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has already peaked, but regrowth hasn’t yet begun. With high stress and only 5–6 hours of broken sleep, your body isn’t getting the steady rhythm it needs to shift into recovery. Locking in a consistent sleep window is your “big domino” right now: it steadies stress hormones, shortens night‑time wake‑ups, and clears the way for regrowth to finally spark.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a target bedtime you can realistically stick to 7 nights a week (e.g., 11:00 p.m.).</li>\n    <li>Set a non‑negotiable alarm or reminder 30 minutes before bed to help you wrap up the day.</li>\n    <li>Commit to getting into bed within 30 minutes of that target, even if you don’t feel “tired yet.”</li>\n    <li>Wake up at the same time each morning, including weekends — no more than 30 minutes difference.</li>\n    <li>If you slip, reset with the very next night; consistency builds from repetition, not perfection.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within 7–10 days; fewer middle‑of‑the‑night wakings; morning energy that feels steadier (less groggy start).</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom scrolling before bed steals your anchor. Quick fix: plug in your phone to charge in another room 30 minutes before bedtime.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one night of aligned sleep at a time. Trust that each rhythm you lock in is one step closer to calmer shedding and visible regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Wind Down Protocol is a simple evening routine that helps your mind and body switch out of “stress mode” so you can fall asleep more easily and stay asleep longer.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding has peaked and is steady, but stress is still active and keeping your body on high alert. With only 5–6 hours of sleep and frequent night wakings, your system doesn’t get the full repair it needs. Anchoring a calming routine now is your big domino: it steadies stress hormones, protects the scalp environment, and sets the stage for regrowth to begin. 🌙</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a 30–40 minute “wind down window” before bed when screens are off and work is done.</li>\n    <li>Dim lights or use a lamp to signal to your body that it’s nighttime.</li>\n    <li>Swap doom scrolling for one grounding activity: stretching, journaling, or reading an easy book.</li>\n    <li>End with 3–5 slow breaths, or a guided relaxation if your mind still races.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster, waking fewer times during the night, feeling less wired in the evenings.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Scrolling your phone out of habit keeps your stress loop active. Quick fix: leave it to charge outside the bedroom.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm night at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Deep Sleep Activation helps you protect the quality of your rest by understanding how alcohol affects your sleep. It’s not about giving it up completely — it’s about making wiser choices so your nights fuel your healing instead of draining it.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase, where shedding has already plateaued but regrowth hasn’t begun yet. Because stress is still pressing on your system, every hour of quality sleep is gold. Alcohol fragments sleep, and with your current 5–6 hours a night and multiple wakings, even small tweaks can shift your body toward the calm needed to re-open regrowth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Notice when you most often drink (e.g., 2–3 nights a week) and how late it tends to be.</li>\n    <li>Limit alcohol on weeknights or set a “no drinks within 3 hours of bed” rule.</li>\n    <li>If you want to keep the ritual, swap with calming replacements — sparkling water with citrus, or an herbal tea.</li>\n    <li>On nights you do drink, pair it with extra hydration and keep it to a single serving.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You may notice fewer night wakings, easier mornings, and a calmer evening mood within a week or two.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom scrolling at night can wipe out the extra rest you gained — quick fix: leave your phone in another room during wind‑down.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one more solid night of sleep means one step closer to regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Deep Sleep Activation"}}
