It trains your body’s inner clock so your sleep becomes deeper and more restorative, even during stressful seasons.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jacque, because you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase of shedding—and your stress load and medication changes are ongoing—anchoring your sleep is your “big domino.” When you go to bed at a predictable hour, your stress hormones settle, which steadies shedding swings and helps your scalp move closer to stabilization by next summer. This one rhythm shift gives your body the safety signal it needs before regrowth can start.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Pick a realistic bedtime you can honor seven nights a week—most do best aiming for 10:30–11 p.m.</li>\n  <li>Set a non‑negotiable wake‑time that allows 7–8 hours of rest. Use a gentle alarm and get up even on weekends.</li>\n  <li>In the evening, start dimming lights and slow tasks 45 minutes before your chosen bedtime so your body recognizes the cue.</li>\n  <li>If you miss your window, still wake at the same time; consistency matters more than total hours early on.</li>\n  <li>Track bedtime consistency in a simple note or on your phone for one week—awareness builds accountability.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up without grogginess by day 4–5, calmer mood swings through the week, and slightly reduced shedding on wash days around week 2.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑night doom‑scrolling keeps your stress loop active—try moving your phone to another room 30 minutes before bed.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each aligned bedtime tells your body “I’m safe now.” One rested night at a time, Jacque, you’re moving from survival toward restoration. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Wind Down Protocol helps you gently shift from “go‑mode” to “rest‑mode” each evening, so your nervous system can calm and your body can move into deeper, more restorative sleep naturally.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jacque, you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase — shedding waves are still active because your body’s stress system hasn’t had nightly time to reset. Right now, calming that system is your big domino. By winding down intentionally, you’ll lower nightly cortisol spikes from the chronic and emotional stress around your medication change, guiding your body toward stabilization and letting the regrowth phase that starts around August 2026 arrive smoothly.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your “switch‑off” point:</strong> One hour before bed, mute notifications and set your phone aside — your goal is to stop doom‑scrolling before your mind catches fire again.</li>\n<li><strong>Create a simple cue:</strong> Dim lights, stretch your shoulders, or wash your face slowly — anything that signals “the day is closing.”</li>\n<li><strong>Breathe for grounding:</strong> Try 4‑7‑8 breathing (inhale 4, hold 7, exhale 8) for three cycles to slow your heartbeat and release the day’s tension.</li>\n<li><strong>Journal release:</strong> Spend five minutes writing any looping thoughts or anxious tasks for tomorrow; then close the notebook — tomorrow can hold them.</li>\n<li><strong>End with softness:</strong> Lie down or sit in low light and visualize your scalp relaxing — each breath carrying more ease into your hair roots.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, waking once or not at all through the night, feeling your heart rate settle as you wind down.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late‑night scrolling can keep stress hormones high; fix it by plugging your phone in across the room and switching to paper pages instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm evening at a time, your body relearns safety, and your hair will follow. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Professional Sleeper is about turning your nights into true recovery time — training your body to fall asleep faster, stay deeply asleep longer, and wake with steadier energy. It’s not about bedtime rules; it’s about creating an internal rhythm that carries your hair and hormones toward calm balance.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jacque, because you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase of shedding — with stress, medication shifts, and hormonal noise all overlapping — your sleep rhythm is the single lever that can quiet that internal storm. Anchored, restorative rest steadies cortisol and rebuilds resilience, nudging you toward stabilization months ahead of schedule and priming your scalp for new growth when regrowth begins next summer.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set your wake anchor.</strong> Pick one wake-up time — even on weekends — that feels realistic (for most, within a 30‑min window). Train your body clock around this cue.</li>\n  <li><strong>Step into sunlight early.</strong> Within 30 minutes of waking, face natural light for 5–10 minutes outside or near a bright window. This starts your “day hormone” clock and locks in your night rhythm.</li>\n  <li><strong>Move your body lightly.</strong> A short walk, stretch, or gentle yoga in morning light reinforces that wake signal without raising stress hormones too high.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protect your last 90 minutes.</strong> Dim overhead lights and give screens a rest. Let your brain feel the difference between work-time and restore-time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep your sleep cave cool and consistent.</strong> 65–68°F works for most people; repeat the same cues nightly (same pillow scent, same order into bed).</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You fall asleep within 15–20 minutes, wake up fewer times, and notice steadier morning mood within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom‑scrolling before bed keeps your stress loop spinning — replace the phone with an eye mask or quiet playlist so your brain knows it’s safe to power down.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one restful morning and steady wake-up at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Consistent Sleep Timing","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Wind Down Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Professional Sleeper","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Calming the Peak So Your Body Feels Safe Again 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Jacque, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> — shedding is still active, but this is the turning point.
