{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Your shedding has been running in waves for months, tied to thyroid/autoimmune stress plus ongoing med changes. Right now you’re in the “peak-to-stabilization” window—no fresh regrowth showing yet. The single biggest lever is sleep regularity: locking your brain and body into a steady rhythm lowers the nightly cortisol surges that otherwise keep pushing follicles into rest mode. This is what helps shorten the lag before stabilization—and opens the door for regrowth. 🌙</p> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Pick a fixed bedtime and wake time, and stay within 30 min every day (yes, weekends count).</li> \n<li>Target at least 8h in bed each night, so your current 7h stretches toward the repair zone.</li> \n<li>Expose your eyes to morning light within 30 min of waking—anchoring your circadian clock.</li> \n<li>Keep your last meal at least 1h before bed (you already do this—keep it steady).</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Bedtime: 10:45–11:15 pm</li> \n<li>Wake time: 6:45–7:15 am</li> \n<li>Morning light: 5–10 min outdoors within 30 min of waking</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Circle your chosen bedtime/wake window and set reminders in your phone for the first week.</li> \n<li>Plan evening tasks (meals, chores, messages) to end by 10:15 pm so you’re free to transition.</li> \n<li>Let family/housemates know you’re trialing a steady schedule—social accountability helps.</li> \n<li>High stress tends to keep the brain “on”; expect resistance the first nights. Stay the course—consistency matters more than perfection.</li> \n<li>If you wake briefly at night, don’t clock-watch. Return to bed, breathing slow, and keep your wake time fixed regardless.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your thyroid/autoimmune flare plus med flux means cortisol is likely running high/erratic. A consistent sleep anchor flattens those spikes, helping follicles exit shed phase sooner.</li> \n<li>Because you noticed shedding ~5 months ago, your worst window likely overlaps spring–summer. Regular sleep shortens the time-to-stabilization so regrowth can begin on schedule rather than drifting later.</li> \n<li>Extra hour in bed restores deep sleep, supporting thyroid tone and iron uptake—both key for hair strength.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If your stress/anxiety feels so high you can’t initiate sleep despite this structure, consider gentle coping add-ons (breathing, journaling); if weeks go by with <6h sleep, flag this with your provider.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 10–14 days you may notice mornings feeling calmer, fewer mini-surges of shedding after washes, and a more even mood through the day.</li> \n<li>Remember: every consistent night builds signal safety for your follicles. You’re not behind—you’re building the ground in which regrowth can root. ❤️</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Toby, your shedding is still in the “comes in waves” stage—very consistent with being mid‑peak from the stress + thyroid/med changes that started earlier this year. Because those triggers are still ongoing, your hair is stuck in a higher‑cortisol loop. A nightly wind‑down is your Big Domino: it signals safety to your body, steadies cortisol before bed, and shortens the time from peak shedding into stabilization and eventual regrowth ✨.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Set aside 20–30 minutes before bed for a repeatable “wind‑down stack.”</li> \n<li>Swap screens/scrolling for a simple cue (dim lamp + light stretching + herbal tea).</li> \n<li>Use a brief journaling or breath practice to discharge ruminating thoughts.</li> \n<li>Finish eating at least 45–60 minutes before bed to lighten sleep onset.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Choose 2 calming activities you can repeat every night (stretching, reading, journaling).</li> \n<li>Create one visual cue (same lamp or scent) that marks “transition to night.”</li> \n<li>Keep wind‑down within the same 30‑min window, even if bedtime shifts slightly.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>About 9:30 pm (or 30–40 min before usual sleep), switch off bright lights and put phone aside.</li> \n<li>Make a non‑stimulating hot drink (caffeine‑free)—the act itself is a body signal.</li> \n<li>Spend 5–10 minutes in light stretch or child’s pose; this lowers muscle tension from stress.</li> \n<li>Write down tomorrow’s “top 3 tasks” to quiet mental loops, then one gratitude note 🌙.</li> \n<li>Do 3–4 minutes of slow breathing (inhale 4, exhale 6) in bed before lights out.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your high stress + anxiety means cortisol likely stays elevated at bedtime; this protocol reliably flattens that curve so fewer follicles are pushed into telogen.</li> \n<li>Since your illness/med triggers in Feb–Mar are ongoing, steady nightly signals help shorten the “wave” pattern of shedding and move you closer to stabilization this fall.</li> \n<li>Light stretching + journaling addresses rumination—your most common barrier—so your 7 hours of sleep become deep repair hours, not restless ones.</li> \n<li>Pairing this with iron/protein work ensures your scalp actually has the building blocks once regrowth signals kick in.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If you find yourself scrolling or working right up to lights out most nights → set a phone alarm 30 min before bed as a hard stop.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 1–2 weeks, you may notice calmer evenings, fewer anxious wake‑ups, and slightly steadier shedding amounts.</li> \n<li>Be patient—stabilization is the bridge phase.
