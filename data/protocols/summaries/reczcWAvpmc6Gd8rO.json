{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Your shedding has been ongoing for more than a year, driven mainly by restrictive dieting thatâ€™s still active. Right now youâ€™re in the stabilization phase â€” the worst has likely passed, and the baby hairs youâ€™ve spotted show your scalp wants to repair. Because sleep is short and often broken, this plan leans on a strong sleep anchor and stress reset to steady your system.
