{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Joelma’s shedding is at its peak — right where recovery begins to turn. The major triggers behind it have already passed, but her follicles haven’t yet caught up. This protocol focuses on steadying the body after the stress of surgery and hormones, anchoring her sleep rhythm and calming the stress loop so stabilization can take hold.
