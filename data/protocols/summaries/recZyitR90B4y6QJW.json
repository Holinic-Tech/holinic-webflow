{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Jet’s hair has reached a steady point—no longer at peak shedding, but not yet showing the new growth she deserves. Persistent hormonal changes and ongoing emotional stress have kept her system on alert, and that’s where this plan steps in. It restores calm from the inside out through steadier sleep, stress reset, and deeper nourishment. By focusing on stabilization first, we prepare the ground for regrowth to take hold and last. Every consistent week rebuilds her follicles’ confidence and moves her closer to visible recovery. 🌱</p>\n<p class=\"cta\"><em>Small daily steadiness now creates tomorrow’s regrowth.</em></p>"}
