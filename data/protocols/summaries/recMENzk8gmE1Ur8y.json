{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Pietra’s hair has been under long-term pressure from chronic stress, hormonal shifts, and ongoing medication needs. Sleep is fragmented, caffeine runs late, and protein is low — all signals that follicles aren’t getting steady recovery time. This protocol focuses on anchoring sleep, calming stress cycles, and rebuilding nutrition foundations so shedding can finally settle.
