{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Bo’s shedding has eased and new growth has begun — clear signs your scalp is ready to rebuild. The main driver, ongoing perimenopausal change, can’t be rushed, but this plan puts control back in your hands now. It anchors your sleep (since short, broken nights have been common), calms daily stress, and strengthens nutrition so new hairs keep maturing. You’re moving from early regrowth toward stronger stabilization — steady, visible progress from here 🌱.</p>\n<p class=\"cta\"><em>Consistency now locks in this regrowth and helps every new strand thrive.</em></p>"}
