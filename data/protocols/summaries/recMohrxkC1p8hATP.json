{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Your shedding has steadied, which means the hardest part is behind you. The main driver still active is ongoing stress, and that can make hair feel slow to bounce back. This plan focuses on anchoring sleep (since short nights and late caffeine are draining your reserves), calming the stress load, and rebuilding nutrition. In the stabilization phase, consistency is what shifts you toward visible regrowth and keeps recovery on track. Youâ€™re not stuck â€” youâ€™re now stepping into control. ðŸŒ±</p>\n<p class=\"cta\"><em>Steady steps today create strong, lasting regrowth tomorrow.</em></p>"}
