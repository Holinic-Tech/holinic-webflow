{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Aidee’s shedding has come in waves, which often happens when the scalp tries to recover while stress remains high. Her current phase is stabilization—baby hairs are returning, but the cycle still feels unpredictable. This plan focuses on calming the stress loop, anchoring sleep despite shift work, and rebuilding nutritional reserves so new growth stays put. Each week helps steady the pattern and move her from fragile stabilization into lasting regrowth. With consistency, the ups and downs can smooth out and strength can return where it’s been lost. ✨</p>\n<p class=\"cta\"><em>Stay consistent—each calm night and nourished day builds visible change ahead.</em></p>"}
