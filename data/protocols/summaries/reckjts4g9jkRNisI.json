{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Right now Toby is in the stabilization phase — the worst of the shedding has passed, but stress is still keeping it from fully easing. Short, broken sleep and low protein meals have also been draining the body’s reserves, which is why this protocol focuses on anchoring sleep, calming the stress cycle, and rebuilding through nutrition. Step by step, this steadies shedding and sets the stage for stronger regrowth. With the right foundations in place, the cycle can shift in your favor ✨.</p>\n<p class=\"cta\"><em>Each consistent choice today moves you closer to visible recovery.</em></p>"}
