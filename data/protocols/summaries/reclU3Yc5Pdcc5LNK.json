{"html":"<h2>Your Personalized Recovery Plan</h2>\n<p class=\"lede\">Your answers show that stress has been running high and sleep hasn’t felt consistent lately — both powerful triggers for shedding. This protocol starts by anchoring your sleep rhythm and creating a calming wind‑down so your body can shift out of “alert” mode. From there we layer in resilience practices to ease daily pressure and simple nutrition upgrades that fuel follicles with steady energy and healthy fats. Together these steps are designed to move you from peak shedding toward stabilization and gentle regrowth. ✨</p>\n<p class=\"cta\"><em>Stay consistent — each practice builds momentum toward visible, lasting recovery 🌱.</em></p>"}
