[{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Toby, you’re standing in the stabilization phase right now—your worst shedding waves are behind you, but regrowth hasn’t started yet. Because your chronic illness flare and medication change are both ongoing, your system is extra reactive to stress and cortisol. Locking down a consistent sleep schedule is the “big domino” that steadies those daily cortisol curves, so your follicles can stop flipping into shed mode and prepare for regrowth 🌙.</p> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Pick one target bedtime and stick within a 30‑minute window every night—including weekends.</li> \n<li>Wake at the same time daily, even after a rough night.</li> \n<li>Get exposure to morning light within an hour of waking.</li> \n<li>Shift your last meal earlier—aim 1.5–2 hours before bed instead of right before sleep.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Bedtime: 11:00 pm (lights out by 11:30).</li> \n<li>Wake time: 7:00 am sharp, seven days a week.</li> \n<li>Wind‑down starts 10:15 pm (screen dim, calming ritual).</li> \n<li>Morning anchor: get daylight + eat a protein‑rich breakfast.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Set an evening reminder at 10:15 pm to start winding down.</li> \n<li>Lower lights + close screens by 10:30 to help melatonin rise.</li> \n<li>Keep caffeine cutoff at 2 pm (you’re already there—just stay consistent).</li> \n<li>Eat dinner a bit earlier—finish at least 90 min before bed.</li> \n<li>Step outside or by a bright window within the first hour of waking.</li> \n<li>If ruminating at night, jot thoughts in a notepad, then release until morning 🌱.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because your illness + stress are still active, a fixed circadian rhythm flattens night cortisol spikes that push hairs into telogen.</li> \n<li>Your shedding waves traced back to Feb–May triggers; consistency now shortens the lag, helping follicles stabilize sooner.</li> \n<li>Stable sleep supports thyroid and progesterone tone, so the iron/protein you do eat goes toward repair instead of stress defense.</li> \n<li>Even mild PMS shifts tend to improve with steadier sleep timing, lowering hormonal turbulence hair feels as “shed orders.”</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Skipping routine on weekends or eating right before bed → more restless sleep, harder cortisol reset. If it happens, reset the very next night.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> By 7–10 days, easier wind‑down, less morning “stress jolt,” and waves of shedding feel smaller by week two.</li> \n<li>Be gentle with yourself—consistency, not perfection, is what re‑teaches your follicles safety. ❤️</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice1_title":"Consistent Sleep Timing"}}]
