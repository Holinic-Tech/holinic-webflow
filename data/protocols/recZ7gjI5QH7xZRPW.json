[{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Toby, your shedding is still in waves and you haven’t yet seen regrowth fuzz. That suggests you’re hovering in the peak/stabilization border. Because your main triggers (chronic illness + med change + high stress) are still ongoing, your body is extra sensitive to cortisol swings. Locking down a fixed sleep schedule is the single “big domino” that steadies cortisol, shortens lag, and moves you toward a true stabilization so regrowth can finally switch on. 🌙</p> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Pick one target bedtime and keep it within ±30 min every night—including weekends.</li> \n<li>Wake up at the same time daily, even if sleep felt restless.</li> \n<li>Expose your eyes to morning light within 30–60 min of waking.</li> \n<li>Keep your last meal at least 90 min before bed to ease digestion and deeper sleep.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Bedtime: 11:00 pm (lights out no later than 11:30).</li> \n<li>Wake time: 7:00 am sharp.</li> \n<li>Wind‑down start: 10:15 pm (screens dim, calming ritual).</li> \n<li>Morning anchor: light exposure + protein‑rich breakfast for cortisol reset.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Set an evening alarm at 10:15 pm to begin wind‑down (stretch, tea, journaling to ease rumination).</li> \n<li>Cut screen brightness and silence notifications by 10:30.</li> \n<li>Place caffeine strictly before 2 pm (you already do this, just keep consistent).</li> \n<li>Shift your last meal earlier—aim 1.5–2 hrs pre‑bed instead of right before sleep.</li> \n<li>Morning: get 5–10 min daylight at a window or walk, even if cloudy.</li> \n<li>If stress spikes at night, keep a notepad by your bed: jot, close book, release until morning.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because your stress and thyroid illness are ongoing, a fixed circadian anchor flattens cortisol spikes that push hairs into telogen.</li> \n<li>Your shedding waves suggest overlapping triggers from Feb–May; this practice shortens lag so stabilization locks in sooner.</li> \n<li>Protein/iron intake is low—steady sleep improves hormonal tone (thyroid, progesterone) so nutrients you do eat can channel into follicles rather than stress defense.</li> \n<li>Regular timing reduces PMS flares and anxiety rumination at night, both of which amplify shedding pressure.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Staying up past midnight on weekends → resets your cortisol clock; if it happens, get back on track the next night without guilt.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Within 7–10 days, earlier sleepiness at 10:30; smoother mornings without a “stress jolt”; slightly smaller shedding waves by week two.</li> \n<li>Remember, you don’t need perfection—just consistent anchors. Every regular night stacks toward regrowth. ❤️</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice1_title":"Consistent Sleep Timing"}}]
