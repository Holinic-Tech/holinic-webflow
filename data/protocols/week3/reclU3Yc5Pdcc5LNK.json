{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> <div class=\"big-domino\"> <p>Toby, you’re in the stabilization phase now: shedding spiked and has leveled but feels heavy (&gt;200 hairs).

Because you’ve had chronic stress on top of a viral illness and heavy training, your body is still burning through protein and key fats faster than you replace them. Right now, what’s on your plate is the BIG DOMINO: better fuel helps buffer cortisol, supply building blocks for regrowth, and shorten the lag before your baby hairs thicken up. 🌱</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Build each meal around 20–30 g of protein (eggs, chicken, tofu, lentils).</li> \n<li>Add omega‑3s 2–3×/week (salmon, sardines, or chia/hemp if plant‑based).</li> \n<li>Pair dark leafy greens + vitamin C foods (spinach + bell pepper) for better iron uptake—especially useful with irregular cycles.</li> \n<li>Shift your last meal to 2–3 hrs before bed for steadier sleep and cortisol balance.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Breakfast: Greek yogurt + berries + chia seeds.</li> \n<li>Lunch: Quinoa bowl with chicken, spinach, roasted peppers, olive oil.</li> \n<li>Snack: Handful of nuts + citrus.</li> \n<li>Dinner: Baked salmon or tofu, sweet potato, steamed broccoli.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Start by upgrading breakfast—hit 25 g protein before noon. This stabilizes cortisol peaks driven by stress.</li> \n<li>Rotate in fish or plant omega‑3 sources twice this week—schedule them like appointments.</li> \n<li>Do a simple meal-prep on Sunday: cook a grain and a protein you can reuse.</li> \n<li>Move dinner earlier by 30–60 minutes to give digestion a head start before bed.</li> \n<li>On nights stress runs high, swap a skipped meal or sugary snack for a warm protein snack (e.g., cottage cheese + fruit) instead of late caffeine. 🌙</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>You’ve only been hitting one solid protein meal per day—upping this to three shifts hairs out of resting mode into growth mode sooner.</li> \n<li>Omega‑3s lower inflammatory signaling that chronic stress keeps high, helping hairs stay anchored.</li> \n<li>Illness in June likely pushed follicles into telogen by Aug; with steady fuel now, regrowth thickening can begin on schedule this fall.</li> \n<li>Irregular cycles suggest iron margin may be thin—pairing greens with vitamin C covers that gap without supplements.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Skipping protein in more than one meal/day → hair recovery drags. Solution: prep grab‑and‑go protein (boiled eggs, edamame packs).</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> More morning energy, less carb crashes, smoother mood within 1–2 weeks.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> By 4–6 weeks, baby hairs feel stronger at the root.</li> \n<li>Remember—you don’t need perfection, just repetition.

The next domino is nourishing new roots so regrowth sticks. With high stress still ongoing and only 1–2 fatty fish meals a month, your follicles likely aren’t getting steady omega‑3s. Good fats calm cortisol spikes and build cell membranes for thicker, shinier strands 🌱. That’s why upping omega‑3 intake now helps move you from “stable but fragile” to “ready for regrowth.”</p> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Add omega‑3 rich foods (salmon, sardines, mackerel, chia, flax, walnuts) 3–4 times/week.</li> \n<li>If using fish oil, check “EPA + DHA” amounts (aim ~500–1000mg combined); avoid bottles that smell rancid.</li> \n<li>Pair fats with protein meals (since you’re only getting one high‑protein meal a day) to support keratin building.</li> \n<li>Limit high‑omega‑6 oils (corn, sunflower, soybean) which can crowd out the benefits.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Target: at least 2 servings fatty fish (or algae oil) + 2 plant sources weekly.</li> \n<li>Start adding walnuts/chia to breakfast within 7 days.</li> \n<li>Choose olive or avocado oil for cooking instead of seed oils.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Pick 2 dinners this week to swap in salmon or sardines.</li> \n<li>Sprinkle chia/flax into smoothies or yogurt at least 3x.</li> \n<li>Batch‑prep walnut packs for work snacks—stress eating with purpose.</li> \n<li>When shopping, read labels—skip vegetable oil blends, go for single‑source olive oil.</li> \n<li>If you try supplements, store them in fridge; discard if fishy odor intensifies.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your chronic stress keeps cortisol high; omega‑3s blunt that signal → fewer fresh hairs pushed into telogen.</li> \n<li>Stabilization now is key: with illness + over‑exercise triggers behind you, fats help shorten the lag before baby hairs cycle back thicker.</li> \n<li>Pairing with protein closes a gap: you usually get just 1 high‑protein meal, so this combo feeds both keratin (protein) and membrane (fats).</li> \n<li>Because your cycles are irregular, fats can also steady prostaglandins → smoother PMS, steadier growth cues.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Stomach upset from fish oil → try with meals or shift to algae oil/whole foods.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Notice smoother scalp skin, shinier strands, or less frizz within 2 weeks.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Cravings or mood swings easing slightly—signals your cortisol curve is steadier.</li> \n<li>Remember Toby: progress in this phase isn’t instant.
