{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” means starting your morning with at least 20–30g of protein, whether from eggs, yogurt, beans, or a quick smoothie. The idea is simple: one smart meal sets the tone for steady energy, calmer stress, and stronger hair foundations all day.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the peak of shedding, where stress and low sleep tug at your reserves. Because you usually get protein just once a day, your follicles aren’t getting steady building blocks. This breakfast step is your “big domino”—it helps calm stress hormones and refuels your body early, moving you toward stabilization and, in time, visible regrowth.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick one go-to option: scrambled eggs with avocado toast, Greek yogurt with nuts, or a chickpea scramble if vegan.</li>\n    <li>Batch-prep ingredients (like boiled eggs, pre-washed greens, or protein powder) so you have a no-excuse safety net in the fridge.</li>\n    <li>Eat within 60–90 minutes of waking—this anchors energy and reduces mid-morning crashes.</li>\n    <li>Rotate between two or three breakfasts so it feels fresh but not overwhelming.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling steadier mid-morning instead of wired or foggy; easier focus at work; fewer urges for sugary pick-me-ups.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping when mornings feel rushed. Quick fix: prep overnight oats with a scoop of protein powder the night before.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—one protein-packed morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"```html\n<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” means making small, intentional shifts in what you eat so your body has the building blocks it needs to grow stronger, healthier hair.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the peak shedding phase, where stress is still pressing on your system and sleep is shorter than your body truly needs. Right now, nutrition is your ‘big domino’—getting enough protein and healthy fats directly steadies stress hormones and fuels the follicles trying to regrow. Every meal you shift toward balance pulls you closer to stabilization, making the coming months gentler and preparing your scalp for regrowth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Plate method: fill half your plate with colorful vegetables, a quarter with quality protein (chicken, eggs, legumes, tofu, fish), and a quarter with slow carbs (quinoa, oats, sweet potato).</li>\n    <li>Add one extra protein boost daily. Aim for 20–30 g at breakfast (e.g., Greek yogurt with seeds, or eggs plus avocado toast).</li>\n    <li>Bring in omega‑3s 2–3 times per week: salmon, mackerel, sardines, or a sprinkle of chia/flax seeds in your smoothie.</li>\n    <li>Snack smart: swap the quick sugar/starch grab for nuts, edamame, or hummus with crunchy veggies.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier afternoon energy, less urge for “stress snacks,” and feeling full longer after meals.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or grabbing only carbs leaves you foggy and worsens cravings. Quick fix: set out protein options the night before so it’s effortless.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing plate at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n```","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Eat More Good Fats” is about steadily adding omega‑3s from clean food or supplements. These healthy fats calm inflammation in the scalp and supply the building blocks your follicles need to regrow thicker, stronger hair.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re right in the peak shedding phase, where stress keeps tugging on your hair cycle. Because you rarely eat fatty fish, your body may be missing anti‑inflammatory support that eases stress load. Adding omega‑3s now is your big domino—it helps cool the scalp environment so shedding can settle sooner and prepares the ground for fresh regrowth as you move toward stabilization.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose 2–3 meals this week to include salmon, sardines, or mackerel. If you don’t like fish, a pure algae‑oil supplement works just as well.</li>\n    <li>Keep portions simple: about a palm‑sized fillet (or 2–3 sardines) gives you a solid dose of EPA+DHA.</li>\n    <li>If supplementing, store capsules in the fridge and check the “use by” date—rancid oils lose their benefit.</li>\n    <li>Balance your fats: cook more with olive or avocado oil, keep fried/omega‑6‑heavy snacks as occasional treats.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or itchy within 1–2 weeks; energy and mood stabilize more evenly through your day; digestion feels smoother when meals consistently include these fats.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping breakfast or leaning on low‑protein meals may blunt the effect—pair omega‑3s with steady protein so follicles don’t run on empty.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—each mindful meal is a quiet step toward calmer shedding and stronger regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Creating Calm Inside the Storm</h4>\n  <p>Right now you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong>, where shedding feels most dramatic. Because your main driver is <strong>ongoing stress</strong>, your body is still caught in a “high-alert” loop. That’s why this first week is all about stabilizing your system — calming the stress signals so your scalp can move out of shed mode and feel safe to regrow.</p>\n  <p>Sleep is the fastest lever here. With only 5–6 hours most nights and 2–3 awakenings, your body isn’t getting the deep phases where cortisol resets and growth hormones surge. By anchoring your sleep/wind-down routine, you send a powerful signal to your follicles that the storm is passing. Combined with stress relief and steady nourishment, this lays the foundation for your stabilization window in the coming months.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> better sleep lowers the stress hormone that prolongs shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm:</strong> steadier rest supports balanced cycles and reduces PMS swings</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deeper sleep boosts growth hormone, fueling new hair cells</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Stress resilience:</strong> calming your evenings builds capacity to handle daily triggers without setbacks</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your sleep, you’re shifting your body from alarm mode into repair — one step closer to calmer shedding and the first wave of baby hairs 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
