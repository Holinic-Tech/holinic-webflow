{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” means starting mornings with a high‑protein, low‑inflammatory meal. It gives your body steady energy while supporting stronger roots from the inside out.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has leveled, and baby hairs are emerging. Right now, your biggest drag is chronic stress plus tight sleep and late caffeine. A protein‑anchored breakfast acts like a reset button: it steadies your blood sugar, calms stress hormones, and helps follicles hold onto their rhythm so regrowth has the best chance to strengthen. This is the “big domino” you can push today to move into visible recovery.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Within an hour of waking, prepare a quick protein‑rich meal (aim for 25–30g).</li>\n    <li>Omnivore option: scramble 2 whole eggs + 2 egg whites with spinach, add smoked salmon or chicken slices.</li>\n    <li>Vegan option: blend 1 cup soy milk, 1 scoop plant protein powder, frozen berries, and nut butter.</li>\n    <li>Keep it fast: prep ingredients the night before so breakfast takes under 5 minutes.</li>\n    <li>Repeat daily — let this become your anchor ritual, even on stressful mornings.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> feeling fuller until lunch, more stable morning energy, less mid‑afternoon crash.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after late nights (a common slip). Quick fix: prep a grab‑and‑go shake before bed so it’s waiting for you.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one strong breakfast at a time, you’re teaching your hair that calm, nourishing rhythm is here to stay. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"```html\n<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Tweak What’s on Your Plate is about gently upgrading your meals so your hair gets the consistent nutrients it needs to grow stronger and fuller over time.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase, which means shedding has steadied and new baby hairs are already appearing. Right now, the missing piece is nourishment: with only one high-protein meal most days and little omega‑3 intake, your follicles can’t fully sustain regrowth. By shaping your plate differently, you’ll give your new hairs the building blocks they’ve been waiting for, helping you progress from “just stabilized” toward visible thickening.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Start your day with protein: aim for 25–30 g at breakfast (e.g., eggs + Greek yogurt, or a protein smoothie).</li>\n    <li>Add one omega‑3 source this week: salmon, sardines, or even chia/flax seeds if you prefer plant‑based.</li>\n    <li>Use the “half plate” check: fill half with colorful vegetables, a palm of protein, and a thumb of healthy fats.</li>\n    <li>Batch-cook one simple recipe you actually enjoy (like a salmon stir‑fry or lentil curry) so weekday meals feel easy, not forced.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> energy steadier between meals, less sugar or caffeine “crashes,” feeling satiated longer.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after a short night’s sleep — quick fix: prep a portable smoothie the night before.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — every balanced plate is another signal to your body that it’s safe to grow. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n```","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Eat More Good Fats” means adding omega‑3 rich foods or supplements so your scalp stays nourished and inflammation calms down — creating a steady foundation for new growth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase: shedding has slowed, and baby hairs are already showing. But ongoing stress keeps your follicles under pressure. With your diet low in omega‑3s (just 1–2 servings a month), this is the domino that brings calm to your scalp’s environment, helping fragile baby hairs mature into visible strands as you move toward regrowth. This is your lever to tip balance back in your favor.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose two meals a week to include fatty fish (salmon, sardines, or mackerel) or a plant-based omega‑3 source like chia seeds or flax.</li>\n    <li>If you use a supplement, look for fish oil or algae oil marked high in EPA & DHA, and discard any that smells “fishy”—that means it’s rancid.</li>\n    <li>Pair omega‑3s with meals that contain some protein, so your body absorbs them more effectively.</li>\n    <li>Limit processed seed oils (like soybean or corn oils) that crowd out the benefits of omega‑3s.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or itchy within 1–2 weeks; improved energy or steadier mood; slight sheen coming back to your strands.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> You sometimes lean on alcohol for stress relief — paired with low sleep, this can blunt omega‑3’s benefits. Quick fix: commit to one extra “no-drink night” this week and notice the difference.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — keep layering these fats into your week and your hair will thank you strand by strand. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats"}}
