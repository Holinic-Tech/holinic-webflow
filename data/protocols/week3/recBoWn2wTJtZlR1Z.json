{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Win Your Day with Breakfast is about anchoring your mornings with a protein‑rich meal that keeps your energy steady and your hair‑building nutrients flowing all day long.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, your shedding is easing and those baby hairs mean your follicles are ready to rebuild. In this stabilization phase, breakfast protein becomes your “big domino” — it steadies postpartum hormones, supports iron absorption, and feeds new growth as you move toward full regrowth this spring. One grounded morning meal can set the tone for calmer energy and stronger strands. 🌞</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your protein target:</strong> Aim for at least 25–30 g of protein within an hour of waking. This could be 3 eggs plus some Greek yogurt, or a vegan shake with pea protein, chia, and almond butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Build your base:</strong> Add slow carbs (like oats, quinoa, or fruit) and a little healthy fat (avocado, seeds) to keep your hormones happy.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it real-life fast:</strong> Prep ingredients the night before — boiled eggs, smoothie packs, or chickpea scramble mix — so you can grab and go even on busy mornings.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate early:</strong> Have a tall glass of water or warm lemon water before coffee to gently wake your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat daily:</strong> For 21 days, hold breakfast steady; notice how your energy levels and mood feel by week two.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll feel fewer mid‑morning crashes, more stable mood, and less craving for sugar or caffeine within 10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or relying only on carbs (toast, pastry) blunts your morning hormone reset. Quick fix: prep your protein first, add the extras second.</li>\n<li>Consistency turns nourishment into momentum — your scalp loves stability as much as you do. Keep showing up for that first meal, one bright morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron levels through food and simple daily habits, so your hair roots regain the energy and oxygen they need to grow strong again.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re entering the stabilization phase after postpartum shedding — baby hairs are sprouting, but your body is still rebuilding iron lost during pregnancy and birth. This step is your “big domino” now: steady iron nutrition supports your red blood cells, reduces lingering fatigue, and fuels the next stage of regrowth as spring 2026 approaches. 🌿</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one iron-rich meal daily.</strong> Include options like lentil or beef stew, tofu with spinach, or chicken liver pâté at least 4 times a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair iron with vitamin C.</strong> Add lemon, bell peppers, or fruit alongside meals to boost absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Limit iron blockers.</strong> Keep coffee, tea, or dairy 1–2 hours away from iron‑focused meals.</li>\n<li><strong>Cook with cast‑iron.</strong> When possible, use a cast‑iron pan for soups or sauces — tiny bits of extra iron naturally leach into food.</li>\n<li><strong>Retest or review.</strong> After 6–8 weeks, if fatigue remains or shedding spikes, talk to your doctor about a ferritin check.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> more steady daily energy, less afternoon slump, and slightly thicker baby hairs along the temples within 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping breakfast or relying on one low‑protein meal a day can blunt iron gains — anchor protein at breakfast with eggs or lentils to keep levels rising.</li>\n<li>Consistency here feeds your follicles from the inside out — one nutrient‑rich bite at a time. 💪🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you refill the healthy fats your body used to grow and nourish new life — now redirected to rebuild your scalp and follicles. Omega‑3s calm inflammation, keep strands strong, and support hormones as they steady post‑partum.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Simona, you’re in your stabilization phase — shedding is easing, and baby hairs are already visible. This is the perfect moment to feed those new roots. Because pregnancy can deplete your omega‑3 stores, restoring them now helps calm lingering hormonal shifts and keeps regrowth steady toward your spring regrowth window. It’s your “big domino” nutrient right now. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Add one rich source daily:</strong> two servings of salmon, sardines, or trout each week. If you don’t enjoy fish, go for algae oil or flax + chia seeds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance your plate:</strong> pair your omega‑3 food with a protein source (eggs, lentils, chicken) to lock in amino acids for stronger strands.</li>\n  <li><strong>Choose freshness:</strong> when using fish oil, check for antioxidant protection (like vitamin E) and avoid bottles that smell “fishy” — that’s a sign of oxidation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reduce omega‑6 overload:</strong> limit deep‑fried or processed seed oils (corn, sunflower); choose olive or avocado oil instead.</li>\n  <li><strong>Consistency:</strong> repeat daily or ≥5 days per week to keep anti‑inflammatory support steady through this recovery window.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> slightly calmer scalp, less dryness in skin/nails, and steadier energy or mood within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping meals or low‑fat eating from busy mom days — fix by prep‑stocking snacks (like nuts or flax yogurt) ready to grab.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds density — one nourishing bite at a time.

Because your main trigger (the postpartum hormone drop after August 2025) has already resolved, this week is all about helping your body find its new steady rhythm. The shedding that peaked around November–December 2025 is easing, and your baby hairs confirm your system is moving toward balance.</p>\n  <p>These practices—anchoring your sleep schedule, winding down gently, and optimizing your bedroom—might seem simple, but they’re the “big domino” for recovery. Consistent, deep sleep lowers lingering cortisol, steadies estrogen and thyroid rhythms, and lets growth hormones rebuild follicle strength each night. With your solid 7–8 hours of rest and minimal night wakings, you’re in a perfect position to lock this in as your foundation.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> Calms the cortisol fluctuations that can prolong postpartum shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm:</strong> Supports estrogen balance so follicles stay in growth mode longer</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Repair time:</strong> Deep sleep triggers cellular repair and new keratin formation</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Energy restoration:</strong> Better rest means higher daytime energy and stronger nutrient absorption</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you signal safety to your body—and that’s what keeps the new growth coming in stronger and steadier 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
