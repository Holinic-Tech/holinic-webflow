{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">  \n<div class=\"big-domino\">  \n<p>Toby, right now you‚Äôre in the <strong>peak shedding phase</strong>‚Äîyour February illness + September over-exercise created overlapping stress and your hair is still in the ‚Äúfall before stabilize‚Äù window. The fastest lever you can pull is your <strong>first meal of the day</strong>. A steady, protein-rich breakfast calms morning cortisol (already running hot with your high stress + short sleep) and feeds follicles what they‚Äôve been missing, so you can cross from shedding ‚Üí stabilization sooner. üå±</p>  \n</div>  \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\">  \n<h4>What to do</h4>  \n<ul>  \n<li>Eat within 1 hour of waking for a cortisol ‚Äúbrake.‚Äù</li>  \n<li>Target 25‚Äì30 g protein + color (plants, fiber) at breakfast.</li>  \n<li>Keep it anti-inflammatory: swap refined carbs for oats, berries, greens.</li>  \n<li>Rotate vegan + omnivore options so breakfast stays enjoyable and doable.</li>  \n</ul>  \n</div>  \n\n<div class=\"practice-plan\">  \n<h4>Your plan</h4>  \n<ul>  \n<li><strong>Omnivore fast option:</strong> Greek yogurt + berries + 2 boiled eggs (‚âà28 g protein).</li>  \n<li><strong>Vegan quickie:</strong> Soy milk smoothie with frozen spinach, banana, oats, pea protein (30 g).</li>  \n<li><strong>Savory base:</strong> Leftover chicken or tofu in a veggie scramble or wrap.</li>  \n<li>Prep overnight oats / smoothie bags the night before to save effort on stressful mornings.</li>  \n</ul>  \n</div>  \n\n<div class=\"steps\">  \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4>  \n<ol>  \n<li>Decide a 3-option breakfast ‚Äúrotation‚Äù you actually like.</li>  \n<li>Shop + prep 2 nights per week, so your mornings feel automatic under stress.</li>  \n<li>Avoid only coffee until 11 a.m. ‚Üí it spikes cortisol, worsens shedding pressure.</li>  \n<li>If late caffeine sneaks in, balance by front-loading breakfast protein next morning.</li>  \n<li>Notice mood steadiness: less mid-morning anxiety = hair protection signal.</li>  \n</ol>  \n</div>  \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\">  \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4>  \n<ul>  \n<li>Protein + early calories soften cortisol peaks wired by illness + over-exercise ‚Üí fewer follicles forced into telogen.</li>  \n<li>Your heavy stress + 6h sleep suggests weaker repair signals. Anchoring breakfast restores circadian rhythm and balances blood sugar, lightening the load on hair cycling.</li>  \n<li>You‚Äôre still within the delay window: February illness means Sep‚ÄìOct is worst. These breakfasts pull stabilization forward so regrowth can start on schedule this winter.</li>  \n<li>With irregular cycles, nourishing protein also supports hormones that buffer stress-driven shedding.</li>  \n</ul>  \n</div>  \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\">  \n<h4>What to look out for</h4>  \n<ul>  \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Skipping breakfast ‚Üí mid-morning crash + caffeine reliance = more night wakeups.
