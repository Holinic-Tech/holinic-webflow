Your shedding slowed after a long period of stress and over‑training, and your next big domino is nourishing recovery. Right now, your body needs consistent protein at sunrise to lower stress hormones and signal safety to your follicles. Starting your day strong keeps energy steadier and moves you closer to visible regrowth by early summer. 🌤️</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Plan your protein anchor.</strong> Aim for about 25–30 g of protein at breakfast. That’s 3 eggs with veggies and avocado toast, or a vegan shake with pea protein, oats, berries, and chia seeds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add color and calm.</strong> Include one anti‑inflammatory add‑on: spinach, berries, turmeric, or flax. Keep it easy — frozen is fine.</li>\n  <li><strong>Prep the night before.</strong> Measure or pre‑blend ingredients so morning effort is minimal. You’re training reliability, not perfection.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking.</strong> This steadies blood sugar and curbs cortisol spikes linked to shedding.</li>\n  <li><strong>Notice how you feel.</strong> Track satiety and focus after breakfast for one week. Small consistency beats big overhauls.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer mid‑morning crashes, smoother workouts, and a lighter stress “buzz” by week two.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after early exercise can prolong stress chemistry — if appetite is low, sip a quick protein smoothie within 30 minutes instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm, protein-powered morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you rebuild your iron stores through simple food shifts, so your follicles have the steady oxygen and energy they need to grow strong new strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Emma, because your shedding began long ago and you’re now in the stabilization phase, your scalp is ready to shift from “survival” back to “growth.” Ongoing stress and a past low‑iron flag have likely slowed that recovery. Boosting iron intake now is your big domino—giving follicles the raw material they’ve been waiting for as your stress levels start to settle toward regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add a true iron anchor meal daily:</strong> build one meal around iron‑rich foods like lean red meat, lentils, or fortified oats paired with vitamin C sources (bell pepper, orange, berries) for better absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce iron blockers:</strong> avoid tea, coffee, and high‑calcium items within an hour of your iron meal.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance your exercise load:</strong> keep one lighter recovery day between intense workouts to reduce the stress drain that competes with iron use.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your energy cues:</strong> if fatigue or dizziness persist past 4 weeks, ask your clinician about ferritin and iron testing—data turns guesses into progress.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier morning energy, less breathlessness during workouts, and less “flatness” in skin tone within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping protein or pairing iron foods with dairy at the same meal can blunt absorption; a simple swap—save yogurt for mid‑afternoon—keeps levels climbing.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, Emma—each balanced plate is quiet repair work your roots can finally count on. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you feed your scalp from within by increasing omega‑3 fatty acids—the gentle anti‑inflammatories that steady shedding and boost new growth signals.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Emma, since you’re in the stabilization phase, your body is finally catching its breath after long‑running stress and intense training. Omega‑3s are your “calm from the inside out” food—they quiet stress chemistry and rebuild flexible cell membranes in follicles. This step is what moves you from simply slowing loss toward visible regrowth as you enter next spring’s regrowth period.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your main source:</strong> Add 2–3 servings per week of salmon, sardines, or trout—or take a reputable algae‑oil capsule if you prefer plant‑based options.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with color and crunch:</strong> Add a handful of walnuts, chia, or ground flax daily to breakfast or smoothies for steady background support.</li>\n<li><strong>Check freshness:</strong> Fish oil should smell neutral, not “fishy.” Store capsules in a cool, dark place and check expiry dates to avoid oxidized oils.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance the plate:</strong> Reduce fried or ultra‑processed oils so the anti‑inflammatory effect of omega‑3s can shine through.</li>\n<li><strong>Track how you feel:</strong> Jot quick notes on energy, skin comfort, and mood for the next two weeks—these are early clues your system is soaking it up.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or itchy, morning energy a bit steadier, and mood swings smoothing out within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast after workouts can blunt absorption—add even a small protein‑plus‑fat meal to lock in the benefit.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—every omega‑rich bite helps your follicles exhale a little more stress each day. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Resetting Your Body’s “Safety Signal” 🌙</h4>\n  <p>Emma, now that you’re in the stabilization phase and your main trigger—chronic stress—remains active, this week is about showing your body it’s safe to pause the shedding cycle. After months of high pressure and heavy training, your system has stayed on alert. These first practices help lower that internal alarm so follicles can finally rest and reset.</p>\n  <p>By anchoring your sleep and winding down before bed, you’re working with your biology: steady evenings reduce cortisol, deepen sleep, and allow growth signals like melatonin and growth hormone to rise naturally. Because your sleep is fairly consistent (7–8 hours) but your recovery load is still high, improving the <em>quality</em> of rest—not just quantity—becomes the big domino that shifts your whole system toward repair.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calms the stress loop:</strong> lowers cortisol so follicles stop receiving “danger” signals</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Restores hormone rhythm:</strong> supports balanced estrogen and thyroid activity for healthy hair turnover</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Boosts nightly repair:</strong> deep sleep triggers tissue renewal and nutrient absorption in the scalp</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Improves recovery:</strong> helps your body handle workouts without tipping back into over‑exertion</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your wind‑down and let your body truly rest, you shorten the distance between stubborn shedding and your first new sprouts of regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
