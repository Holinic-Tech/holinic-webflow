After months of hormonal shifts and stress, your follicles crave consistent nourishment to rebuild. Breakfast protein is your “big domino” right now: it steadies blood sugar, calms post‑stress hormones, and signals your body that growth is safe again. This meal anchors your recovery as density starts to return. 🌱</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Plan the night before:</strong> Decide on your quick protein base (e.g., eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu scramble, or a plant‑protein smoothie).</li>\n  <li><strong>Add color + healthy fats:</strong> Mix in berries, spinach, or avocado to keep inflammation down and micronutrients high.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build to 25–30 g protein:</strong> 2 eggs + ½ cup Greek yogurt, or 1 scoop vegan protein + nut butter + chia in a smoothie does it easily.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat within 60 minutes of waking:</strong> This steadies cortisol and prevents mid‑morning crashes that can stall recovery.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep it fun:</strong> Rotate flavors — chocolate‑banana smoothie one day, savory tofu wrap the next — so you look forward to it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable morning energy, fewer sugar cravings, and stronger nails or baby hairs feeling thicker within 2 weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast when mornings feel hectic; fix it by prepping overnight oats or smoothie packs ahead of time.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing breakfast at a time. You’re feeding the roots of your comeback, literally. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you rebuild your iron stores through simple food choices and timing tweaks, so your hair has the oxygen and nutrients it needs to keep growing strong and thick.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, your shedding has steadied and new baby hairs are showing—your scalp is ready to regrow. Because you’ve had low iron before, this is your “big domino” now: steady iron levels help hair bulbs shift from fragile to firmly rooted. Locking that down in this early regrowth phase turns those tiny sprouts into durable strands as your body leaves the stress and hormonal turbulence of last year behind.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add an iron hero daily:</strong> Include one iron-rich meal per day—think lentils, spinach, lean beef, tofu, or fortified cereal.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with vitamin C:</strong> Add citrus or bell pepper to help your body absorb more iron.</li>\n<li><strong>Dodge the blockers:</strong> Keep coffee, tea, and dairy at least an hour away from iron-rich foods.</li>\n<li><strong>Stabilize intake:</strong> Aim for roughly equal portions each day rather than big iron “bursts.” Consistency tells your body it’s safe to make new hair.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your energy:</strong> Note if you feel less tired or dizzy—those are signs your stores are rebuilding.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Brighter skin tone within two weeks, steadier energy through the day, and fewer hairs snapping at the root by the third week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping protein at breakfast limits iron use; keep at least 15 g of protein with your morning meal to anchor absorption.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one balanced plate at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you raise your intake of clean omega‑3s — the anti‑inflammatory building blocks that nourish your follicles and balance oils from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ana, you’ve entered the regrowth start phase — shedding has steadied and those baby hairs are peeking through. After the post‑pill shifts and that short dieting window, your scalp needs steady supply of healthy fats to rebuild its shine and calm leftover inflammation. This step is your big domino: consistent omega‑3 intake now strengthens early regrowth and locks in the progress you’ve been waiting for.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Add one rich omega‑3 source daily — salmon, sardines, mackerel, or a plant alternative like chia or flax.</li>\n<li>If fish is rare in your diet, use a fresh‑scented algae or fish oil supplement (look for EPA + DHA ≥ 1000 mg per day).</li>\n<li>Keep oils in a cool, dark spot and discard any that smell “fishy” or sour — that means they’ve gone rancid.</li>\n<li>Pair fats with protein at meals; this steadies hormones and supports iron uptake for even stronger roots.</li>\n<li>Mark three days per week to repeat— Monday, Wednesday, Friday—and track how your scalp feels by week two.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or flaky; hair looks slightly glossier; mood or focus steadies through the afternoon.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> if busy evenings make you skip dinner fats, prep a small jar of chia pudding or keep tinned fish handy — quick fixes prevent nutrient dips.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one omega‑rich bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑grounding Your Body So Regrowth Can Take the Lead 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Ana, you’re entering the <strong>regrowth‑start phase</strong>—the point when shedding has steadied and your follicles are ready to rebuild. Because your main trigger, the <strong>post‑pill hormonal change</strong>, has resolved and stress has eased, this week is about signaling safety to your body again. The calm, consistent routines you build now tell your system, “it’s okay to grow.”</p>\n  <p>Your sleep rhythm is already fairly stable (6–7 hours, almost no night wakings), which means you’re in a great position to deepen recovery. The practices this week—anchoring bedtime, winding down gently, and optimizing your sleep space—are the “big domino” that steadies cortisol and lets growth hormones do their quiet repair work overnight. That’s how follicles shift from survival mode back into healthy cycling.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower nightly cortisol:</strong> reduces the stress signal that keeps follicles paused</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper restorative sleep:</strong> boosts growth hormone release for new cell formation</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal rhythm reset:</strong> supports balance after the post‑pill transition</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Nutrient utilization:</strong> improves how iron and protein are directed toward regrowth</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Resilience base:</strong> prepares your body for the rebuilding work of Weeks 2 and 3</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every calm evening routine you complete this week is another signal to your scalp that the storm has passed—and that it’s time to grow again. 🌱</em></p>\n</div>"}}
