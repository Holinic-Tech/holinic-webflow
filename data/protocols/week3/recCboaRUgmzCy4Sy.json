Balancing blood sugar and cortisol early helps turn off stress signals that fuel hair loss and supports the regrowth you’ve already begun to see. This is your big domino—steady energy equals steady follicles. 🌅</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor breakfast within an hour of waking.</strong> Even on shift days, eat soon after you rise to signal “safe to grow.”</li>\n<li><strong>Hit 25–30 g of protein.</strong> For omnivores: 2 eggs + salmon or turkey, or Greek yogurt with nuts.  \nFor plant‑based: tofu scramble with lentils, chia protein smoothie, or soy yogurt + hemp hearts.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color and calm.</strong> Include one anti‑inflammatory side—berries, leafy greens, or avocado—and sip water or herbal tea instead of caffeine first thing.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Prep jars or wraps the night before so shift changes don’t derail you.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Mid‑morning energy lasts longer; sugar cravings fade; you feel calmer within a week because cortisol is steadier.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Doom‑scrolling before breakfast can delay your first meal—set your phone aside until you’ve eaten and hydrated.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one balanced morning at a time, your body remembers it’s safe to grow again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently lift your iron levels through smart food pairings and simple meal tweaks, so your follicles get the oxygen and nutrients they need to sprout stronger strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, you’re in the stabilization phase—your body’s calming after months of stress, but your follicles still need steady fuel to rebuild. Low iron can quietly hold back new growth even when shedding slows. Since you’ve had iron deficiency before and only one high‑protein meal daily, this step is your big domino—it turns fragile baby hairs into lasting regrowth as your stress hormones balance out.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Add an iron anchor meal:</strong> Each day, include one iron‑rich food—like lentils, leafy greens, or lean red meat—paired with vitamin C (citrus or bell pepper) to boost absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Separate tea/coffee:</strong> Enjoy them at least 60 minutes after meals; tannins block up to half the iron uptake.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protein‑plus breakfast:</strong> Start one morning meal with 25–30 g of protein and a small spinach or bean side. It signals your follicles that nutrition is reliable again.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check energy cues:</strong> Notice if afternoon fatigue eases or nails look rosier—these are quiet signs of better iron use.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep it consistent:</strong> Aim for at least three balanced, iron‑friendly meals across the week before layering supplements.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Brighter skin tone, fewer dizzy spells, and scalp tingling or less shedding during shampoo within 2 weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping lunch or late doom scrolling often leads to missed meals and weaker uptake—prep quick iron snacks or set a 9 pm “screen down & tea later” reminder.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds strength from the inside out—one nutrient‑rich bite at a time. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you feed your scalp from the inside out. Omega‑3 fats calm inflammation that keeps follicles “stuck,” and they steady hormones that tend to swing under stress.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eva, your hair is entering its stabilization phase — those baby hairs you’re seeing are proof of recovery. But because stress remains high and your omega‑3 intake is low, your follicles still need stronger fuel to switch fully into regrowth. This is your big domino: by adding the right fats now, you’ll cool stress‑related inflammation and lay the foundation for thicker strands through spring and summer.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Start your day with balance:</strong> Include one source of omega‑3 at breakfast — a spoon of chia or ground flax, or a few walnuts on oatmeal or yogurt.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add a main‑meal hero:</strong> Twice a week, swap typical proteins for salmon, sardines, or trout. If you’re plant‑based, choose algae‑based DHA/EPA capsules (check manufacture date to avoid rancid oil taste).</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair with color:</strong> Combine fats with antioxidant foods like berries or greens; they protect these oils and your scalp’s cell membranes from oxidation.</li>\n  <li><strong>Store smart:</strong> Keep oils and supplements sealed, cool, and away from light — once they smell “fishy,” toss them.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stay consistent:</strong> Keep a simple checkmark journal for each omega‑3 meal so the habit locks in by week three.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Within 7–14 days, you may notice steadier mood, smoother scalp comfort, and less dryness along your ends or skin.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Late‑night doom scrolling can raise cortisol and undo some calming effects of these fats — set a 9 pm “phone bed” alarm as your quick fix.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reclaim Your Calm to Begin Stabilizing 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Eva, you’re now in the stabilization phase — the hardest part is behind you. Because your main trigger has been ongoing emotional and chronic stress since early 2025, this week is all about helping your body feel safe again. When stress hormones stay high, your follicles stay in “pause mode.” The practices ahead — sleep anchoring, winding down, and optimizing your bedroom — are how we tell your body, “it’s okay to grow again.”</p>\n  <p>Even though you sleep 7–8 hours, your shifting schedule and late meals keep cortisol and blood sugar slightly unstable. This week’s structure restores rhythm: steady bedtimes lower cortisol, deeper sleep boosts growth hormone, and calmer evenings reduce inflammation that quietly stalls regrowth. These small consistency cues are the big domino that flips your system from survival to recovery.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> Calms cortisol surges from ongoing emotional pressure</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> Supports thyroid and reproductive balance affected by PCOS</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Sleep depth:</strong> Extends restorative phases when follicles receive growth signals</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Resilience building:</strong> Trains your system to handle daily stress without renewed shedding</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you commit to a steady wind‑down, you teach your body safety — and that’s what unlocks calmer shedding and stronger new growth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
