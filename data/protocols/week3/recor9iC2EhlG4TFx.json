It means crafting a quick, high‑protein, anti‑inflammatory first meal — whether eggs and greens or a plant smoothie — that steadies mood, stress, and appetite before they spiral.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Devy, you’re in the stabilization phase — your hair’s shedding spike has likely passed, but stress is still running high and baby hairs haven’t yet sprouted. A steady, protein‑rich breakfast is your “big domino” right now: it anchors cortisol early and tells your follicles, “We’re safe.” This single change helps your body shift from stress maintenance into regrowth mode as 2026 begins.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your base:</strong> Eggs with veggies, Greek yogurt and berries, or a tofu‑scramble wrap. Aim for 25–30 g of protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Add calm fats:</strong> A spoon of chia seeds, avocado, or a drizzle of olive oil balances inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Include color:</strong> Add one fresh fruit or handful of leafy greens for antioxidants that protect follicles.</li>\n<li><strong>Prep in advance:</strong> Pre‑boil eggs or blend smoothie packs at night so breakfast takes under 5 minutes.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> This steadies blood sugar, settles morning anxiety, and keeps energy smooth until lunch.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling calmer mid‑morning instead of wired; fewer afternoon crashes; hunger steadier across the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast on busy days (common when stress is high) — fix it by keeping a ready‑to‑grab option like a protein smoothie or boiled eggs.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds confidence — one grounded morning becomes one grounded week, and that’s when your scalp starts trusting the process. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” is about gently upgrading your meals so your body has the steady nutrients it needs to keep shedding calm and support new growth from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Devy, you’re in the stabilization phase—your hair is starting to find its footing after months of stress‑driven shedding. Because high stress quietly drains key nutrients, nourishing your plate now is your big domino: it tells your follicles it’s finally safe to grow again. By feeding yourself more consistently—especially proteins and omega‑3s—you’ll set up the regrowth that usually unfolds by early spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start your day with strength:</strong> build breakfast around ~30 g of protein—try eggs with spinach, yogurt with oats and chia, or tofu stir‑up with veggies.</li>\n<li><strong>Include “shiny fats” daily:</strong> add avocado, walnuts, or drizzle extra‑virgin olive oil; aim for salmon, sardines, or algae oil 2–3 times a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Color your plate:</strong> fill half of it with varied vegetables or fruit—this boosts antioxidants that lower stress load in follicles.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay steady:</strong> eat balanced meals every 4–5 hours to keep hormones and energy stable through stressful days.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier energy all afternoon, fewer cravings for quick sugar, and less post‑meal bloat within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping meals on hectic days (stress spikes and delays regrowth). Quick fix: keep a ready‑to‑grab protein snack like Greek yogurt or almonds.</li>\n<li>Consistency here builds quiet momentum—each balanced bite tells your body, “I’m safe to grow again.” 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you feed your scalp from the inside out. By adding omega‑3–rich foods and avoiding low‑quality oils, you calm inflammation and rebuild the lipids that line every hair follicle cell.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Devy, your shedding began about 3–6 months ago when stress was high—and you’re now entering stabilization. Your body is ready to recover, but stress hormones can still block fresh growth if scalp nutrition is thin. Omega‑3 fats are your big domino this week: they quiet the stress signal and prime follicles to shift from rest to regrowth as you move toward early 2026. One steady change in your meals can tip that balance.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Add one palm‑size serving of fatty fish (like salmon, sardines, or mackerel) twice a week, or a daily teaspoon of algae or fish oil that’s stored in the fridge and smells clean—never “fishy.”</li>\n<li>Swap out processed or vegetable‑seed oils for olive or avocado oil in everyday cooking.</li>\n<li>Sprinkle chia, flax, or walnuts onto breakfast or snacks for plant‑based omega support.</li>\n<li>Keep your oils away from heat and light; rancid fat works against your hair goals.</li>\n<li>Note how your skin and scalp feel after two weeks—less dryness means it’s working.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> skin feels more supple, scalp itch diminishes, and post‑wash shedding starts to ease within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping meals or eating right before bed (you noted late dinners) can blunt absorption—try finishing dinner at least 2 hours before sleep.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—keep those good fats flowing, and your follicles will thank you. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Reclaiming Calm So Your Follicles Can Reset 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Devy, you’re in the stabilization phase — the storm of shedding from chronic stress has begun to ease, but your system still needs the signal that it’s safe to shift gears. Because your main trigger is ongoing stress, this week is all about creating calm, predictable rhythms that tell your body, “the threat has passed.” With your 6–7 hours of sleep and a few night wakings, these first practices help anchor the foundation your hair recovery depends on.</p>\n  <p>When you regulate sleep and bedtime cues, you lower cortisol — the stress hormone that keeps follicles in “shed mode.” A steady wind‑down routine and an optimized sleep space let your body enter deep sleep, where growth hormones and repair signals activate. That’s the quiet background work that starts reversing stress damage and prepares the scalp for regrowth in the coming months.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer stress response:</strong> lowers cortisol so follicles can exit the shedding phase</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal rhythm reset:</strong> restores daily balance between rest, energy, and hair‑growth signals</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper restorative sleep:</strong> triggers natural repair and nutrient delivery to roots</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Foundation for regrowth:</strong> sets up the conditions your scalp needs before baby hairs appear</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your sleep and calm your system, you move one step closer to steadier shedding and visible regrowth ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
