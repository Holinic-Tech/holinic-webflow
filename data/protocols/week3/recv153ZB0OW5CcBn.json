{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Jeanne, your shedding has peaked and is stable now—this is the bridge between “holding steady” and letting regrowth start 🌱. But with heavy periods (iron risk), late caffeine, alcohol nights, and stress-eating, your mornings often begin on the back foot. A high‑protein, low‑inflammatory breakfast is the domino that steadies cortisol, fills iron/protein needs, and sets the stage for baby hairs to finally show in your next phase.</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Aim for ~25–30 g protein within 1 hour of waking.</li> \n<li>Pair protein with slow carbs + healthy fat to keep blood sugar stable.</li> \n<li>Keep options fast, 5–10 min max (so stress or groggy mornings don’t derail you).</li> \n<li>Rotate vegan + omnivore options so it feels fresh and not restrictive.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Omnivore ideas:</strong> Greek yogurt bowl with berries + pumpkin seeds; 2 eggs + avocado on wholegrain toast; smoked salmon rice cakes with cucumber.</li> \n<li><strong>Vegan ideas:</strong> Protein smoothie (pea or soy powder, spinach, frozen banana, nut butter); chickpea scramble + salsa; overnight oats + hemp hearts + soy milk.</li> \n<li>Batch-prep 2 weekday options so you just grab + go.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Set your wake window (even on weekends, ±30 min).</li> \n<li>Drink water before coffee to cut the urge for emotional‑eating “quick sugar.”</li> \n<li>Choose your prepped breakfast—aim to eat before that first caffeine hit (especially since you often sip after 3 pm).</li> \n<li>Add an iron‑friend: pumpkin seeds, spinach, or salmon—gentle insurance given your heavy periods.</li> \n<li>On alcohol mornings, lean extra on steady protein + greens to blunt cortisol spikes.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Protein first → steadier cortisol, less mid‑morning crash → fewer hairs pushed into telogen.</li> \n<li>Because your July stress trigger is ongoing, food stability lowers the “background noise” of cortisol, moving you faster toward regrowth.</li> \n<li>Added protein + iron sources give follicles the raw material to thicken shafts once stabilization tips toward new growth.</li> \n<li>Smoother mornings lessen emotional eating patterns that otherwise fuel inflammation and shedding.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Skipping breakfast → afternoon sugar/alcohol cravings spike → more night waking. If this repeats, re‑name your backup breakfast option and prep it nightly.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> By week 2 you need less mid‑morning caffeine; steadier energy through your cycle; noticing less clump shedding on wash days.</li> \n<li>You don’t have to be perfect, Jeanne ❤️—two solid protein breakfasts most weekdays already start nudging you from “stable” toward “regrowth start.”</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice2_html":null,"practice3_html":null,"practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: ","practice3_title":"Practice 3: "}}
