{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” helps you front-load your morning with balanced, anti-inflammatory protein—fueling energy, hormones, and hair growth signals from the moment you wake up.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, your body’s been under chronic stress while navigating perimenopause, and together they’ve flattened your regrowth momentum. In this stabilization phase, a steady, protein-rich breakfast is your “big domino”—it stabilizes blood sugar, calms stress hormones, and finally gives your follicles the building blocks they’ve missed. This one shift now helps move you from shedding plateau toward visible baby hairs by mid-year.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Decide your style:</strong> Pick either an omnivore or vegan base—something you’ll actually look forward to each morning.</li>\n<li><strong>Build your plate:</strong> Aim for about 30 g of protein. Try two eggs + smoked salmon and sautéed spinach, or for a vegan start, blend pea protein with frozen berries, almond butter, and oat milk.</li>\n<li><strong>Add anti-inflammatory color:</strong> Include leafy greens, berries, or avocado to boost antioxidants that protect new growth.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> It sets your cortisol rhythm and prevents midmorning crashes or cravings that amplify stress shedding.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it fast & fun:</strong> Batch‑prep smoothie packs or boiled eggs on Sunday so breakfast never becomes another stressor.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More steady morning energy, fewer 10 a.m. “crash” feelings, and calmer appetite control within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If late‑night snacking or drinks (>3 nights weekly) make you skip breakfast, prep the night before and keep water by your bed—your morning mind will follow your setup, not willpower.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each grounded morning signals your body that it’s safe to grow again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron through food and supportive habits, so oxygen and nutrients reach your follicles more efficiently—and new growth can finally take root.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, you’ve been in a long stabilization phase—shedding has slowed but hasn’t tipped toward regrowth yet. Low iron and perimenopausal changes often hold hair in “pause mode.” By restoring your iron stores now, you give follicles the oxygen and raw material they’ve been waiting for, helping you move from this plateau toward visible baby hairs by midsummer.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Start each day with iron-friendly protein.</strong> Choose eggs, lentils, or lean meat with a squeeze of lemon or a slice of fruit to improve absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add a “green booster” meal 3x/week.</strong> Spinach, kale, or broccoli paired with vitamin‑C foods (like peppers) mimic a natural supplement.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reduce blockers.</strong> Keep coffee, tea, and calcium-rich foods at least 1 hour away from iron-rich meals—they interfere with uptake.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch for energy shifts.</strong> Better stamina and fewer dizzy spells usually appear before hair improvements.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Better concentration, brighter complexion, and slightly faster nail growth within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Relying on wine or cocktails to relax after work can hinder iron absorption—swap for a magnesium-rich evening drink instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency compounds—each balanced plate tells your follicles “we’re safe to grow again.” Keep feeding that signal. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” is about bringing omega‑3s—the calming, anti‑inflammatory fats—back onto your plate, so your scalp and hormones can finally work together instead of against each other.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, you’re in your stabilization phase—shedding has held steady but hasn’t yet eased. Because chronic stress and perimenopause both inflame the scalp environment and deplete protective fats, upping omega‑3s now is your big domino. It steadies hormones, cools inflammation, and sets your follicles up for the regrowth phase coming by midsummer 2026. This is the nutritional nudge that helps your scalp exhale. 🪷</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick one main source.</strong> Aim for two portions of fatty fish per week (salmon, sardines, trout). If you avoid fish, use a clean algae oil with both EPA and DHA.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a daily drizzle.</strong> Rotate olive oil, ground flax, or chia into salads and smoothies for steady omega support.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch freshness.</strong> Store oils cool and closed tight; skip any fish oil that smells “fishy” or metallic—it’s likely rancid and counterproductive.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance your plate.</strong> Include a thumb‑size portion of fat alongside protein at breakfast—this keeps blood sugar and stress hormones calmer through the day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp itching eases, fewer wiry shed hairs, smoother mood or energy during the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> over‑relying on alcohol to wind down can block the fat‑to‑hormone benefit; swap in tea or magnesium water most nights.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each balanced meal is a quiet signal to your body that safety and growth are returning. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Bringing Your System Back to Steady Ground 🌱</h4>\n  <p>Jet, you’re in the stabilization phase — that steady but often frustrating middle ground where shedding hasn’t yet eased, but your body is finally ready to listen. Because your main trigger, chronic stress since 2020, is still ongoing and layered with perimenopausal hormone shifts, this week is about creating the calm foundation your follicles need to stop overreacting.</p>\n  <p>Each practice this week — anchoring your sleep, winding down gently, and pausing alcohol — works on the same big domino: restoring rhythmic balance. Deep, consistent sleep lowers cortisol, while alcohol-free nights help your liver clear excess hormones and reduce nighttime awakenings. That combination improves growth-hormone pulses and nutrient delivery to the scalp, signaling safety and stability to each follicle.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower cortisol spikes:</strong> helps follicles exit “danger mode” and hold onto strands longer</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> steadier estrogen and progesterone support stronger regrowth conditions</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Restorative sleep:</strong> boosts overnight repair and scalp circulation</li>\n    <li>💧 <strong>Liver and hydration support:</strong> alcohol pause improves detox and nutrient absorption</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Stress buffering:</strong> builds the inner stability that sets up your next phase of visible recovery</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every calm evening and steady night’s rest tells your body, “it’s safe to regrow.” Keep showing up for that signal — it’s how shedding begins to settle and renewal takes root. 🌱</em></p>\n</div>"}}
