A solid, protein-anchored breakfast is your big domino: it calms morning cortisol surges, steadies hormones that affect shedding, and fuels recovery ahead of your stabilization window this spring. This single change helps your body shift from stress response toward repair mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a consistent breakfast window:</strong> Eat within 60 minutes of waking to stabilize blood sugar early.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a 30-gram protein plate:</strong> Aim for 20–30g of protein—e.g., 2 eggs + Greek yogurt + a handful of berries, or for vegan option, tofu scramble with spinach and avocado toast.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color and fat:</strong> Include one bright plant (spinach, peppers, or berries) and a source of healthy fat like olive oil, chia, or nuts to reduce inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Prep ahead:</strong> Batch-cook tofu or boil eggs on Sunday so weekday mornings feel effortless.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat mindfully:</strong> Take a few calm breaths before your first bite. That pause signals your nervous system to shift out of “fight or flight.”</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll feel steadier energy through the morning, fewer cravings by noon, and less hair shedding in your sink within 2–3 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or reaching for processed carbs while doom scrolling keeps stress hormones high; instead, prep your meal the night before and take five screen-free minutes while eating.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds calm, and calm builds regrowth — one grounded morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you reshape each meal so your hair—and your body—get a steadier flow of the nutrients they need to rebuild strong strands from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jacque, during this <em>peak</em> phase—when shedding can still surge—the fuel you give your body truly sets the pace toward stabilization. With only one high‑protein meal most days and ongoing stress from medication changes, your follicles need more consistent amino acids and healthy fats to calm the fallout cycle and prepare for regrowth by mid‑2026. Think of this as feeding your recovery from the inside out—your “big domino” this week.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Start with breakfast.</strong> Include around 30 g of protein—try eggs with spinach and avocado, or Greek yogurt with seeds and fruit.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add hair‑building color.</strong> At lunch and dinner, fill half your plate with deep greens, orange veggies, or berries for antioxidants.</li>\n  <li><strong>Layer healthy fats.</strong> Add a spoon of olive oil, a handful of nuts, or salmon twice a week (or algae‑oil supplement if plant‑based).</li>\n  <li><strong>Hydrate and slow down.</strong> Sip water through the day and give yourself time to chew—this improves absorption and steadies appetite under stress.</li>\n  <li><strong>Repeat for consistency.</strong> Choose simple mixes you enjoy and repeat—your body thrives on predictable nourishment.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> more stable energy between meals, fewer afternoon crashes, and a subtle drop in day‑to‑day shedding within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> doom‑scrolling during dinner can trigger stress digestion (and missed cues of fullness). Quick fix: put the phone down for the first 15 minutes and breathe between bites.</li>\n  <li>Small daily choices weave big results—each balanced plate is another signal of safety to your body. You’re rebuilding from the inside, one meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps your scalp and hormones quiet down by giving your body the omega‑3s it can’t make on its own. These healthy fats reduce internal “fire” and support the follicles’ ability to shift back into growth mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jacque, in this peak phase, steady omega‑3 intake is your big domino. With high stress, hormonal shifts, and that recent medication change still active, your body needs inflammation‑cooling fats to buffer stress hormones and calm the shedding cycle. Beginning this now lays the foundation for your stabilization window by mid‑2026—and helps nourish the next wave of regrowth waiting beneath the surface. 💫</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Choose one daily source of omega‑3: 2–3 servings of salmon, sardines, or trout weekly—or a high‑quality algae oil if you prefer plant‑based.</li>\n<li>Keep oils fresh: store fish oil capsules or flax/chia oil in the fridge and discard if they smell “fishy” or metallic (a sign they’re rancid).</li>\n<li>Balance fats: limit fried and ultra‑processed foods that crowd out healthy fats; cook with olive or avocado oil instead of seed oils.</li>\n<li>Aim for consistency: build your “good fats” into one meal every day this week—morning smoothie, lunchtime salad drizzle, or roasted veggies at dinner.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> skin feels less dry or itchy, scalp tenderness eases, and mood or focus steadies within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping meals when stressed—this keeps stress hormones high; quick fix: prep a snack with nuts or avocado so you stay nourished.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one balanced plate at a time, you’re teaching your body that safety and growth are possible again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Finding Calm in the Peak Phase — Your First Step Toward Control 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Jacque, because you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase and your main trigger — a medication change from last November — is still active, this week is about helping your body feel safe again. When stress and medication shifts overlap, your system stays in “high alert,” keeping follicles stuck in the shedding cycle. These first practices are designed to quiet that signal so your body can begin its path toward stabilization by mid‑2026.</p>\n  <p>With your 6–7 hours of somewhat inconsistent sleep and high stress levels, restoring rhythm is the most powerful lever you have right now. Deep, predictable sleep lowers cortisol, balances thyroid and reproductive hormones, and resets the timing messages that tell follicles to hold onto their strands. The wind‑down and bedroom optimization steps this week aren’t just about rest — they’re how we start convincing your body that the danger has passed.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower cortisol:</strong> reduces the stress signal that keeps follicles in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rebalance:</strong> steadier sleep patterns help normalize thyroid and androgen activity</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper recovery sleep:</strong> re‑activates growth hormone release for tissue repair</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Foundation for regrowth:</strong> calmer nights now set the stage for visible baby hairs in the months ahead</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your sleep routine, you’re telling your body it’s safe to shift from loss toward renewal — one calm evening at a time 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
