{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” is about starting your morning with 25–30 g of protein and a mix of anti‑inflammatory foods, so your hormones and energy stay steadier all day.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, you’re entering the regrowth phase — your body’s already proving it can recover with those new baby hairs. But in perimenopause, low morning protein can let stress hormones steal the spotlight again. This single upgrade steadies blood sugar, tames cortisol spikes from short sleep, and fuels the follicles that are trying to thicken back up. Think of it as breakfast turning your “improving” into “flourishing.”</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Front‑load protein.</strong> Aim for 25–30 g within 60 minutes of waking. Examples: 2 eggs + ½ cup Greek yogurt; or a smoothie with plant protein powder, chia, and frozen berries.</li>\n<li><strong>Add anti‑inflammatory color.</strong> Mix in spinach, avocado, or berries — real color signals antioxidants your scalp loves.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it fast and repeatable.</strong> Prep ingredients the night before; use the same base (like oats or smoothie) and change flavor notes.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate before caffeine.</strong> A glass of water first stabilizes morning cortisol so your brew feels less like a jolt, more like a lift.</li>\n<li><strong>Track how you feel.</strong> Energy steadier by 10 a.m.? Less snacking? Those are your green lights that your metabolism is recalibrating.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy before lunch, reduced mid‑morning hunger, and a calmer scalp feel within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast on rushed mornings can backfire into afternoon sugar cravings — fix it by prepping protein packs or smoothie bags at night.</li>\n<li>Consistency here builds hormonal calm — one strong breakfast at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you fine‑tune everyday meals so your body gets the steady nutrients it needs to grow strong, shiny new strands. It’s not a diet—it’s a nutrient‑support reset designed for hair that’s rebuilding itself.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, you’re in early regrowth—your body is already trying to lay down new keratin, but it needs more steady protein and fatty acids to keep those baby hairs thriving. Because perimenopausal shifts can blunt nutrient absorption, these small tweaks are your big domino: they turn food into real‑time growth fuel, helping you move from fragile fuzz toward visibly thicker strands over the next few months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor each meal around protein.</strong> Aim for at least two palm‑sized portions daily—start your morning with 30 g (e.g., eggs with Greek yogurt or tofu scramble with edamame).</li>\n  <li><strong>Add healthy fats for shine.</strong> Include one omega‑3 source every day: chia pudding, ground flax, or a spoon of algae‑oil–based dressing if you skip fish.</li>\n  <li><strong>Fill half your plate with color.</strong> Load up on dark greens, bell peppers, and berries for antioxidants that calm inflammation around follicles.</li>\n  <li><strong>Batch‑prep “go‑to” meals.</strong> Cook proteins and veggies twice weekly so it’s effortless to grab balanced plates when you’re tired or on the go.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hydrate evenly through the day.</strong> A glass of water with every meal keeps scalp tissue plump and helps nutrients circulate.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier afternoon energy, fewer sugar cravings, improved scalp comfort, and baby hairs staying put through washing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast or relying on low‑protein snacks—if that happens, pre‑mix a yogurt‑and‑seed cup to grab in the morning.</li>\n  <li>Consistency around mealtimes and protein will quietly compound. Every balanced plate is one vote for stronger regrowth—keep showing up for your hair, one forkful at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you bring omega‑3s — the “calm and repair” fats — into your daily meals so your scalp stays nourished, hormone balance steadies, and new hairs have the building blocks to thicken and anchor.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Bo, because you’re in the early regrowth phase and your main trigger is ongoing perimenopause, stabilizing inflammation and hormones is key. Right now, your follicles are rebuilding — omega‑3s are the single nutrient that accelerate this shift from fragile fuzz to strong strands. Getting this steady fat signal each day is your big domino toward lasting regrowth through early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose your daily source.</strong> Aim for one palm‑sized serving of fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) at least 3 times a week, or a high‑quality algae oil supplement if you’re plant‑based.</li>\n  <li><strong>Support freshness.</strong> If using fish oil, store it sealed and refrigerated — a fishy taste means oxidation, which cancels its benefits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance your plate.</strong> Include these fats with proteins (e.g., eggs or tofu) and fiber (veggies) to improve absorption and steady blood sugar.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reduce competing oils.</strong> Cut back slightly on seed oils (sunflower, corn, soybean) to rebalance your omega‑6:3 ratio.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track energy changes.</strong> Note mood, joint comfort, and scalp hydration in week two — your body often whispers progress before your mirror shows it.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Softer scalp texture, less overall dryness, and baby hairs lying flatter and shinier within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping balanced meals — your single‑protein lunch habit may leave fats under‑absorbed. Quick fix: pair seafood or chia pudding with leafy greens and a teaspoon of olive oil.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds internal calm — each mindful bite of good fat quietly strengthens your next growth wave. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Setting the Foundation for Stronger Regrowth 🌼</h4>\n  <p>Bo, you’re in the early regrowth phase — a hopeful place to be. Your main trigger, ongoing perimenopausal hormone shifts, is still gently influencing your system, which is why this week’s focus on stabilization is so powerful. You’ve already moved past the heaviest shedding, and now your job is to help your body feel consistently “safe” enough to keep those baby hairs growing stronger.</p>\n  <p>Because you’re sleeping only 5–6 hours a night with 2–3 wakings, your stress and repair hormones haven’t had their full overnight reset. The practices this week — anchoring bedtime, winding down, and optimizing your bedroom — are the big dominoes that calm cortisol and support steadier estrogen balance. When your nervous system rests, follicle inflammation quiets down, and your scalp’s microcirculation improves, setting the stage for visible thickening over the next few months.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Deeper rest:</strong> restores cortisol balance and tells your body the stress phase is over</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> steadier estrogen-progesterone rhythms nurture follicle stability</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Nighttime repair:</strong> boosts growth hormone release for cellular renewal</li>\n    <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Scalp recovery:</strong> improved circulation feeds oxygen and nutrients to follicles</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every evening you commit to your wind‑down and consistent lights‑out, you’re helping your body trust the process — calmer shedding today, stronger growth tomorrow 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
