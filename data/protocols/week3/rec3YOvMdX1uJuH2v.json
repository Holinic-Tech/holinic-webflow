A strong, balanced breakfast—especially with protein—stabilizes your stress response and gives your body the amino acids it needs to transition toward recovery and regrowth by spring 2026. This meal becomes your big domino for calmer energy and steadier strands.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Plan tonight:</strong> Before bed, decide tomorrow’s breakfast—fast options work fine: Greek yogurt + fruit, or tofu scramble with vegetables.</li>\n    <li><strong>Hit 25–30 g protein:</strong> Combine any of these: 2 eggs + smoked salmon, or a vegan smoothie with pea protein, chia, and berries.</li>\n    <li><strong>Add color and fiber:</strong> A handful of greens or frozen berries adds antioxidants that calm post‑surgery inflammation.</li>\n    <li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> This anchors your body clock and steadies cortisol, helping your hair cycle settle faster.</li>\n    <li><strong>Repeat and rotate:</strong> Pick two favorite combos and alternate all week—consistency beats variety right now.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More even mid‑morning energy, fewer sugar cravings, and a calmer mood within 7–10 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after late nights of phone scrolling can spike stress hormones; if that happens, set your phone aside 30 min earlier and prep food before bed.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you fine‑tune your meals so your follicles get all the nutrients they need to start producing strong, steady strands again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Joelma, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> — shedding feels unrelenting after your July surgery, but this is your pivot point. Right now, your follicles are alive yet low on raw materials, especially protein since you usually hit that in only one meal. This week’s focus becomes your “big domino” — fueling every cell so your scalp can shift from survival mode toward stabilization before spring rolls around.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Build three protein‑solid meals.</strong> Aim for about a palm‑sized serving (20–30 g) of protein at breakfast, lunch, and dinner. Eggs, Greek yogurt, fish, chicken, tofu, or lentils all count.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color at every plate.</strong> Include two different colored vegetables or fruits each day to load antioxidants that calm post‑surgery inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair healthy fats with your greens.</strong> A drizzle of olive oil or a small handful of nuts helps you absorb fat‑soluble hair nutrients like vitamin E and biotin.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate smarter.</strong> 6–8 glasses of water or herbal tea daily; your scalp’s microcirculation depends on it.</li>\n<li><strong>Batch and simplify.</strong> On Sundays, prep 2–3 easy protein bases (boiled eggs, lentil salad, grilled fish) so weekday meals are effortless.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier energy through the afternoon, less brittle ends within two weeks, and meals that actually keep you full for 4+ hours.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast when mornings feel rushed — place a ready protein option (like yogurt cup or smoothie) at eye level in the fridge to fix it fast.</li>\n<li>Consistency compounds — each balanced plate whispers safety to your body, one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Calm Your Scalp and Body is a grounding mini‑ritual to quiet your nerves when anxiety spikes, so your body can shift from “fight or flight” back into repair and hair growth mode.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Right now, Joelma, you’re in the peak phase — shedding feels loud but follicles are still alive. After surgery and hormonal changes, your stress axis is hypersensitive. Each calm reset you create sends the message, “we’re safe now,” helping you move toward stabilization. This is your big domino: steadying your nervous system will speed the turn from shedding to regrowth by spring. 🌱</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Pause the spiral.</strong> When panic hits about shedding, place a hand over your scalp and breathe out longer than you breathe in — four seconds in, six out — repeat 5 rounds.</li>\n    <li><strong>Ground your body.</strong> Feel your feet connect to the floor or your seat to the chair. Name one thing you can see, one you can feel, and one you can hear. This anchors you in the present.</li>\n    <li><strong>Relax your scalp.</strong> Using fingertips, sweep small circles from front to crown for one minute, not digging in, just warming the skin.</li>\n    <li><strong>Move the energy.</strong> Take a slow 5‑minute walk or stretch — you already use exercise to cope, so let movement finish the stress cycle.</li>\n    <li><strong>Close with gratitude.</strong> Say quietly, “My body is healing.” This tiny phrase retrains your brain each time.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> sleeping more deeply within a week, shorter stress flare‑ups when you notice shedding, and scalp tension easing.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> if rumination loops at night, avoid scrolling in bed; swap for breathing or gentle massage before lights out.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm breath at a time, love. 🌿</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Calm Your Scalp and Body","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Calming the Peak So Your Follicles Can Recover 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Joelma, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> — shedding may look alarming right now, but your follicles are still alive and responsive. Because your main trigger (the July 2025 surgery and brief hormonal shift) has resolved, this week is about helping your body realize that the danger has passed. Stabilizing your daily rhythm tells your system, “it’s safe to stop shedding.”</p>\n  <p>Your sleep is fairly good at 6–7 hours, but tightening your bedtime window and deepening rest is the fastest lever right now.
