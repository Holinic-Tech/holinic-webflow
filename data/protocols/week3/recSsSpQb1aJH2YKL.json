It centers around starting mornings with a protein‑rich, low‑inflammatory meal that’s quick, satisfying, and easy to repeat.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Megan, because you’re in the stabilization phase after a long spell of stress‑driven shedding, your body is craving rhythm and nutrient reliability. A strong breakfast locks in blood‑sugar balance and lowers the cortisol surges that still echo from that Dec 2024 emotional strain. This simple morning anchor becomes your “big domino,” helping calm hormones and prepare your scalp for regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Wake, hydrate, and eat within an hour.</strong> Aim for 25–30 g of protein right after waking to steady energy and reduce mid‑morning crashes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build your plate:</strong> choose a base protein (eggs, Greek yogurt, or a vegan smoothie with pea protein), add colorful fruit or veggies, and finish with healthy fats like chia or avocado.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep it anti‑inflammatory.</strong> Use olive oil, spices like turmeric or cinnamon, and skip refined sugars or processed meats.</li>\n  <li><strong>Batch-prep 2 options.</strong> Pre‑blend smoothie packs or boil eggs so your morning decision takes 60 seconds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check in daily.</strong> Notice how your focus and hunger shift when breakfast hits that 25 g protein mark.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier mid‑day energy, fewer sugar cravings, and improved mood clarity within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast after a late caffeine fix can ignite stress hormones again—set your last coffee before 3 pm and prep breakfast the night before.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds confidence, and confidence builds growth—one nourishing morning at a time. ☀️</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you naturally lift your iron levels through daily food choices and simple habits that protect absorption—so your follicles finally get the oxygen and nutrients they’ve been waiting for.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Megan, since you’ve had low iron before and your shedding still feels stuck even in the stabilization phase, this is your turning point. Right now, your body wants to shift from survival mode toward regrowth, but it can’t build strong keratin without enough iron in circulation. Bringing your iron stores back up gives your scalp the fuel it needs to start visible recovery by early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor one iron meal daily:</strong> Aim for one plate that includes heme‑iron foods (beef, lamb, chicken, or sardines) or a plant pair (lentils + vitamin C food like bell pepper or orange).</li>\n<li><strong>Time your coffee/tea:</strong> Wait at least 60 minutes after any iron‑rich meal before brewing coffee or black tea—these block absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Add an enhancer:</strong> Include a small squeeze of lemon, kiwi, or ½ cup strawberries with your iron source—vitamin C triples uptake.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid the blockers:</strong> On iron‑focused meals, skip dairy or calcium supplements until two hours later.</li>\n<li><strong>Track energy:</strong> Notice steadier focus or less afternoon fatigue as early markers of better oxygen delivery.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less “tired‑all‑the‑time” feeling, brighter skin tone, and slightly reduced scalp tenderness within 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑day caffeine still sneaking in (after 3 pm) can keep stress hormones high and slow iron uptake—swap for herbal tea after lunch.</li>\n<li>Consistency stacks on itself. Keep showing up for your meals—each balanced plate is one quiet vote for stronger strands ahead. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” means adding omega‑3‑rich foods or a clean supplement so your body has the raw materials it needs to calm inflammation, support hormones, and rebuild strong new strands from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has likely eased a bit but regrowth hasn’t yet shown. Since emotional stress is still active, your scalp’s oil balance and follicles can stay inflamed. Omega‑3 fats are your biggest ally here: they quiet that background stress chemistry and lay the foundation for healthy new growth as you move toward your regrowth window in early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Choose one daily source: aim for 2 servings of fatty fish per week (salmon, sardines, mackerel) or take an algae‑ or fish‑based omega‑3 providing at least 1000 mg combined EPA + DHA.</li>\n  <li>Keep oils fresh: store capsules or bottles away from heat and light; discard anything smelling fishy or metallic — that’s rancidity.</li>\n  <li>Pair with meals: fats absorb best alongside protein and fiber (e.g., fish with rice and vegetables, or a supplement during lunch).</li>\n  <li>Limit competing oils: swap seed‑oil dressings (soy, sunflower) for olive or avocado oil to keep your intake balanced.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier mood and energy within a week, calmer scalp itching or flaking by week 2, and slightly less “greasy” roots over time.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping meals or eating late (<1 h before bed) can blunt absorption — aim for earlier, balanced dinners with a little healthy fat.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds quiet strength — one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your Body After Prolonged Stress 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Megan, you’re now in the stabilization phase — the toughest part is behind you. Your main trigger, ongoing emotional stress that began last December, has kept your system on high alert for months. This week is about gently telling your body, “it’s safe to exhale.” By restoring predictable sleep and calming your evenings, you create the internal signal that the danger has passed — the key domino that allows shedding to settle and follicles to reset.</p>\n  <p>With your 5–6 hours of broken sleep, late caffeine, and 2–3 night wakings, the stress loop is still active. The practices this week — setting a sleep anchor, building a wind‑down stack, and drawing a caffeine fence — help lower nighttime cortisol and restore your natural growth rhythm. When your body spends more time in deep sleep, it releases growth hormone, repairs follicles, and rebalances stress and androgen levels that influence scalp oil and shedding.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Reset your stress hormones:</strong> lower evening cortisol so follicles can leave the shed phase</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deepen restorative sleep:</strong> boost growth‑promoting hormones released at night</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Stabilize daily rhythms:</strong> consistent bedtimes signal safety to your nervous system</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Prime follicles for regrowth:</strong> calmer, well‑oxygenated scalp prepares for baby hairs in early 2026</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you’re retraining your body to move out of stress mode and into regrowth mode — one calm evening at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
