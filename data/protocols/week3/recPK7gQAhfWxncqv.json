{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” helps you anchor your morning with a protein‑rich, anti‑inflammatory meal so your energy, hormones, and hair nutrition start strong from the very first bite.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, you’ve reached the stabilization phase—shedding has steadied, but your follicles are quietly preparing to grow again. Because low iron and one‑meal‑a‑day protein have likely slowed that recovery, this breakfast habit is your big domino. It supplies amino acids and gentle iron absorption early in the day, setting the stage for visible baby hairs in the regrowth window ahead. 🌤️</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your first anchor.</strong> Within an hour of waking, plan a 25–30 g protein breakfast—this tells your body, “fuel is abundant, we can grow.”</li>\n<li><strong>Mix nutrients, not rules.</strong> Pair protein with healthy fats and colorful produce. Think: spinach‑mushroom omelet with olive oil, or tofu scramble with avocado and tomatoes.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it grab‑and‑go.</strong> For busy mornings, blend a scoop of vegan protein powder with oats, chia, frozen berries, and nut butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Iron synergy tip.</strong> Add a squeeze of citrus over veggies or fruit on the side; vitamin C boosts your iron uptake naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat daily.</strong> Consistency turns this from “a meal” into a metabolic signal your follicles trust.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> A steadier morning mood, fewer mid‑day crashes, and stronger nails or less post‑shower shedding within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast when mornings feel rushed—prep overnight oats or a boiled‑egg box the night before to remove friction.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, one nourishing morning at a time. You’re teaching your body that growth is the new normal, Eeva. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you quietly rebuild your iron stores through food and timing, so your follicles have the oxygen and strength they need to restart growth.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Eeva, your shedding has steadied—this is stabilization—but new fuzz hasn’t yet shown. Low iron slows that next step. By focusing here, you lay the groundwork that turns “stable” into “sprouting.” The nutrients you add this week act like fuel for regrowth that’s due to begin around early 2025. This is your big domino: restore iron, and your follicles will finally have the energy to wake up.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start the day iron-strong:</strong> Include one iron-rich food at breakfast—like eggs, oats with pumpkin seeds, or fortified cereal—and add a source of vitamin C (berries, orange slices) to boost absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Power lunch:</strong> Choose a high‑protein, iron‑dense meal: lentil soup, chicken, or beef paired with greens. Aim for at least 20–30 g of protein to help carry iron where it needs to go.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind the blockers:</strong> Avoid tea, coffee, or calcium supplements within an hour after iron‑rich meals—these quietly reduce absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening rhythm:</strong> If you take a supplement under guidance, have it between meals with water or juice, not dairy. Keep this timing steady so your body learns the signal.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your energy:</strong> Notice how your overall vitality feels; rising energy often precedes visible baby hairs.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> a subtle lift in afternoon energy, warmer hands and feet, and reduced post‑wash strands by week 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping protein at lunch—your iron needs its team. If you miss it, add a quick boiled egg or handful of edamame later that day.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you rebuild the nutrient foundation your follicles rely on. By adding clean omega‑3s—EPA and DHA—you calm inflammation in the scalp and strengthen cell membranes that allow hair shafts to grow thicker and healthier.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Eeva, your shedding has steadied, which means your follicles are ready for nourishment that flips the switch toward visible regrowth. Because your diet currently lacks fatty fish or algae oil and low iron has been noted before, this step is your big domino—feeding your scalp what it’s been quietly missing so those new baby hairs can finally push through as you move from stabilization toward early regrowth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose your main omega‑3 source: either 2 portions a week of salmon, sardines, or mackerel, or a daily algae‑oil capsule if you prefer a plant option.</li>\n    <li>Check freshness—fish should smell clean, never “fishy.” For supplements, make sure the label mentions recent batch dates and “rancid‑free” guarantees.</li>\n    <li>Pair your omega‑3 with a meal that contains some fat (like avocado or olive oil) to boost absorption.</li>\n    <li>Balance your fats by keeping fried and processed oils low; they compete with the anti‑inflammatory benefits you’re adding.</li>\n    <li>Stay consistent for 3–4 weeks before judging results; your skin and mood may show changes first.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Smoother scalp feeling within 10–14 days, less morning dryness or flaking, subtle shine returning to lengths.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you skip meals or eat only one protein‑rich meal a day, absorption suffers; pair omegas with balanced meals to fix this quickly.</li>\n    <li>Consistency compounds—each small meal choice lays the groundwork for the stronger strands you’ll soon see. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Resetting Your Inner Rhythm for Steady Ground 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Eeva, you’re now in the stabilization phase — shedding has finally leveled off, but the follicles still need reassurance that it’s safe to regrow. Because your main trigger is an ongoing nutritional and mild hormonal imbalance, this week is all about calming internal stress signals and setting a steady rhythm your body can trust.</p>\n  <p>Your sleep habits are actually a strong foundation — 7–8 hours with nearly no night wakings gives your system the nightly repair time it craves. By creating consistent sleep anchors and a gentle wind‑down, you’ll help lower cortisol and support hormone balance so nutrients like iron and protein can be used for repair instead of stress management. This is the “big domino” that allows follicles to shift from guarded mode into quiet recovery.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Restorative signaling:</strong> steadies cortisol and helps your body exit the chronic stress loop</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> supports stable estrogen and thyroid rhythm for stronger roots</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> improves nutrient delivery and oxygen flow to the scalp</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deep‑sleep repair:</strong> maximizes growth‑hormone release during your most restorative hours</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every evening you protect your wind‑down and anchor your sleep, you’re giving your follicles the steady signal they’ve been waiting for — calmer shedding now, and soft new growth on the horizon 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
