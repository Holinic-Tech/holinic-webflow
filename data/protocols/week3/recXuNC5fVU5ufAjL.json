{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Jeanne, you’re still in the peak shedding window—your illness and spring stress lined up, so hair is under double pressure right now. Breakfast is your “big domino” because it sets the cortisol curve for the day and gives iron + protein early, which your survey shows can be low. A steady morning meal helps slow active loss and nudges your body toward stabilization sooner. 🌱</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Eat within 60–90 min of waking to anchor your body clock.</li> \n<li>Aim for ~25–30g protein + iron-rich food (vegan or omnivore).</li> \n<li>Keep it fast: 5-min builds, minimal prep, repeatable favorites.</li> \n<li>Balance with a slow carb or fruit to keep blood sugar calm.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Omnivore option:</strong> 2 scrambled eggs + spinach + black beans; or turkey wrap with hummus.</li> \n<li><strong>Vegan option:</strong> Tofu scramble with veggies + pumpkin seeds; or smoothie with pea protein, oats, and frozen berries.</li> \n<li>Iron-booster: pair with vitamin C (citrus, peppers) for better absorption.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Set out one or two “default” breakfasts you like—no overthinking when stress is high.</li> \n<li>Prep staples the night before (soaked oats, chopped greens, or boiled eggs).</li> \n<li>If appetite is low, start with half serving—consistency matters more than size.</li> \n<li>Replace your <em>12–3pm caffeine</em> jolt with a protein-rich snack if you feel energy dip—keeps afternoon cortisol smoother.</li> \n<li>Log protein grams for 3–4 days until you can “eyeball” ~25–30g easily.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Front-loading protein + iron gives your follicles the building blocks they need for regrowth once shedding slows.</li> \n<li>A morning meal blunts the stress hormone spike; with your moderate stress history, this helps transition from peak shedding toward stabilization.</li> \n<li>Your past iron deficiency risk + slight PMS symptoms suggest keeping ferritin steady is key—early iron-rich meals help most.</li> \n<li>Because illness ended in late Sept, hair shifts can still worsen for 2–3 months; this breakfast habit shortens that lag and cues your body sooner toward repair.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Skipping breakfast, relying only on coffee, or skipping protein → more energy dips + prolonged shedding pressure.</li> \n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Smoother energy mid-morning, less urge for caffeine, steadier mood within 7–10 days.</li> \n<li>❤️ Be gentle with yourself—this isn’t about perfection, it’s about building one anchor habit that tells your body: safety, fuel, and time to heal.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n</section>","practice2_html":null,"practice3_html":null,"practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: ","practice3_title":"Practice 3: "}}
