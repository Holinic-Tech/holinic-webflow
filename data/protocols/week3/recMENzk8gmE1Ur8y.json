Low protein intake (only one solid meal a day) leaves your hair short on building blocks. A nourishing morning meal becomes your “big domino,” calming cortisol swings from poor sleep and night‑shift fatigue so your body can start allocating nutrients back to regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set your morning window:</strong> Aim to eat within 60 minutes of waking — even on shift days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build your plate or bowl:</strong> Include at least 25–30 g of protein plus colorful plants or whole grains. Omnivore example: 2 eggs + Greek yogurt + a handful of berries. Vegan option: tofu scramble + avocado + chia pudding.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add anti‑inflammatory sides:</strong> Sprinkle cinnamon or turmeric, or drizzle olive oil over veggies.</li>\n  <li><strong>Plan the night before:</strong> Prep chia mix, hard‑boil eggs, or portion smoothie ingredients so fatigue doesn’t win.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair with hydration:</strong> Drink a full glass of water before caffeine to gently wake digestion.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Morning energy feels more stable; fewer mid‑morning crashes; scalp feels less sore or reactive.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after doom‑scrolling late — that spikes cortisol again. Quick fix: set phone on “Do Not Disturb” overnight and keep a ready‑to‑grab option in the fridge.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced breakfast at a time, you’re teaching your body it’s safe to shift from fight‑or‑flight into grow‑and‑repair mode. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you quietly rebuild your iron stores through small, food-based upgrades—so your follicles actually get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow stronger hairs again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, your long-term shedding and ongoing hormonal shifts have likely slowed how iron travels to your scalp. Because you’re in the stabilization phase, this is the moment when restoring those nutrient reserves turns shedding from “stuck” to “ready to regrow.” Getting your iron up is your big domino—once it moves, your energy, mood, and hair vitality all lift together.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one iron-rich food daily.</strong> Choose lean red meat, lentils, or dark greens cooked with olive oil at least once per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair iron with vitamin C.</strong> Add a squeeze of lemon or a few berries with the same meal—it triples absorption naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid iron blockers around meals.</strong> Keep coffee or tea at least one hour apart from your iron-rich foods.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your energy curve.</strong> If fatigue lightens and your color brightens, you’re on track; schedule labs with your doctor if not improving after six weeks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Brighter skin tone, less mid‑day slump, and slightly fuller feel at your roots within 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑afternoon coffee can block iron uptake—swap for herbal tea or warm water with citrus instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—let your plate do quiet healing work every day, and your scalp will follow. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you nourish your scalp from the inside out by upping your omega‑3 intake—those silky lipids that calm inflammation, balance hormones, and keep follicles flexible enough to grow strong new hair.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase—shedding still feels stubborn, but your worst months are behind you. Now your follicles need anti‑inflammatory support to quiet the stress and hormonal noise that’s been building for years. Omega‑3s are your “big domino” this week: they nudge your body from survival toward repair, making the ground fertile for new growth as you move toward the regrowth stage. Start nourishing that next chapter today.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one oily fish meal</strong> this week—salmon, sardines, or trout—baked or grilled, not fried.</li>\n<li><strong>On non‑fish days,</strong> take a clean algae or fish‑oil supplement providing about 1,000 mg combined EPA + DHA. Check that it smells fresh (rancid oil works against you).</li>\n<li><strong>Pair fats with protein</strong>—for example, salmon over lentils or eggs with avocado—to steady hormones and amp absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce omega‑6 competition</strong> by swapping seed oils for olive or avocado oil when cooking.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay consistent</strong> for at least 3 weeks; your scalp’s oil balance shifts gradually, not overnight.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feeling less tight or itchy, fewer wiry ends, and an easier time detangling by week 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping meals during late‑night doom scrolling can blunt results—set your phone aside 30 min before bed and prep breakfast protein instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑teaching Your Body That It’s Safe to Stop Shedding 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase — the hardest part is behind you, but your follicles are still on alert from years of chronic stress and hormonal changes that haven’t fully settled. This week is about showing your system safety again through rhythm and rest. Because stress and sleep deprivation have been ongoing, your body still receives mixed “danger” signals that keep shedding active. These next few days are your first chance to change that pattern.</p>\n  <p>When you anchor your sleep (even with 6–7 hours and a few night wakings), you lower cortisol and allow growth hormones to switch back on during deep sleep. Cutting late caffeine and winding down before bed help your adrenal system remember calm. As your nervous system steadies, circulation to the scalp improves and follicles can shift out of survival mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress reset:</strong> steadier cortisol levels tell follicles it’s safe to pause shedding</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper sleep:</strong> promotes nighttime repair and healthy hormone rhythms</li>\n    <li>🌿 <strong>Energy balance:</strong> restores nutrient delivery to roots after long-term strain</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone support:</strong> gentle sleep cues help rebalance signals affected by menopause and medication shifts</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm bedtime this week is a message of safety to your body — one that slowly turns shedding down and opens the door to regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
