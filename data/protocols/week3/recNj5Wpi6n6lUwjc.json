A steady, protein‑anchored breakfast is your “big domino” right now: it calms stress hormones, steadies appetite, and gives your scalp the amino acids it needs to move toward stabilization by spring. This single habit can quiet the urgency your body feels each morning.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prep tonight:</strong> Set out ingredients or soak oats/chia while the kettle’s on. Tomorrow starts smoother when breakfast feels half done.</li>\n<li><strong>Go for 30 g of protein:</strong> Examples: 2 eggs + Greek yogurt parfait; or a vegan smoothie with pea protein, spinach, almond butter, and berries.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color + fat:</strong> A handful of berries or avocado helps tame inflammation and keeps you full longer.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within 45 min of waking:</strong> This tells your nervous system “you’re safe”—which helps lower cortisol before stress hits.</li>\n<li><strong>Repeat, not perfect:</strong> Aim for 5 solid breakfasts this week rather than chasing perfection. Your consistency matters most.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Steadier energy until lunch, fewer mid‑morning cravings, and a calmer mood within 7 – 10 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after late‑night drinks can undo progress—set out a simple option (protein bar + banana) even on groggy mornings.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each grounded morning helps your body move out of “fight‑or‑flight” and closer to regrowth. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you quietly rebuild your iron stores through small, daily choices—so your follicles have the oxygen and nutrients they need to stay anchored and grow stronger again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Victoria, your body’s juggling perimenopause and high stress—both can sap iron and slow regrowth. Since you’re still in the peak shedding phase, this is your “big domino.” Restoring iron now steadies your energy and gives your follicles the raw fuel they’ve been missing, helping you move toward stabilization by early summer.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add an iron‑rich food at lunch or dinner daily.</strong> Rotate lean red meat, lentils, tofu, or spinach with vitamin‑C foods (like peppers or citrus) to boost absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid blockers at the same meal.</strong> Keep tea, coffee, and calcium supplements at least one hour away from your iron‑rich meals.</li>\n<li><strong>Use cast‑iron cookware 3–4 times a week.</strong> It releases trace amounts of iron into food without changing flavor.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair protein and fiber.</strong> Including some beans, eggs, or chicken with your vegetables helps even out blood sugar, which protects your hair environment during stress.</li>\n<li><strong>Check your lab status if possible.</strong> A ferritin test can confirm progress and guide whether you need professional support.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You feel less light‑headed standing up, warmer hands and feet, and steadier energy between meals—all within about two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping meals or leaning on alcohol to manage stress blocks absorption. Quick fix: have a protein snack before drinking or cut back to weekend nights only.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one iron‑rich forkful at a time. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you gently raise your intake of omega‑3s — the anti‑inflammatory building blocks your scalp and hormones use to create calm and steady growth signals.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Victoria, in this peak phase your follicles are under pressure from both perimenopause shifts and steady stress. Boosting omega‑3s right now is your “big domino” — it soothes stress chemistry, steadies hormone swings, and sets the stage for shedding to slow before mid‑2026. You don’t have to overhaul your diet — just feed your follicles what they’re craving most: calm, oil‑rich support.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Add one rich source daily:</strong> Choose between salmon, sardines, trout, chia pudding, or a teaspoon of high‑quality algae or fish oil (check freshness — no fishy smell).</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance your plate:</strong> Pair protein (20–30 g) with a thumb‑size portion of these fats at breakfast or lunch to boost absorption and steady energy.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch the ratios:</strong> Limit fried or highly processed oils (soy, corn, sunflower) since they crowd out omega‑3 benefits.</li>\n  <li><strong>Protect your oils:</strong> Store any supplements or nuts away from heat and light to prevent rancidity.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track your shine:</strong> Note scalp comfort, skin softness, or smoother energy through the week — these are early signs the fats are working.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less scalp tightness, calmer mood after stressful days, and a subtle increase in skin hydration within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals or compensating with wine at night blunts absorption — swap that drink for sparkling water with citrus on evenings you boost fats.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — feed your follicles regularly and they’ll repay you in new strength and smoother shedding rhythm. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steadying Your Body When Shedding Feels at Its Peak 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Victoria, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> of the cycle — shedding is at its heaviest, but your follicles are still fully capable of recovery. Because your main triggers — <strong>perimenopause and chronic stress</strong> — are both ongoing, this week is about creating safety signals inside your body. By anchoring your sleep, winding down your nervous system, and pausing alcohol, you tell your body: “it’s time to stop fighting and start stabilizing.”</p>\n  <p>Right now, your hormones and stress messengers are competing for control. Late‑evening drinks and variable bedtimes can keep cortisol and adrenaline active through the night, which delays healing. The practices this week calm those signals so your body can restore nightly rhythms — balancing cortisol, supporting estrogen’s stabilizing effect, and allowing your follicles to stay in growth mode longer. This is the “big domino” that sets the rest of your recovery in motion.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Nervous system reset:</strong> lowers cortisol spikes that keep the scalp in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> supports smoother estrogen–progesterone shifts during perimenopause</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Deeper sleep cycles:</strong> boost growth‑hormone release for cellular repair</li>\n    <li>💧 <strong>Reduced inflammation:</strong> fewer nightly stress surges mean calmer follicles</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your wind‑down and skip that extra glass, you move closer to calmer shedding and the moment your scalp begins to feel alive again 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
