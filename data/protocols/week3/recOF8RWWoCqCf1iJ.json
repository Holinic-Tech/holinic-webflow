{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Win Your Day with Breakfast is about starting every morning with 25–30 g of protein — enough to steady energy, lower stress hormones, and tell your body it’s safe to grow hair again.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Heather, you’re in the peak phase, when shedding is loudest. Perimenopause and recent weight loss mean your body’s repair signals are running low. A strong, protein-rich breakfast is your big domino — it calms cortisol, stabilizes blood sugar, and gives follicles the amino acids they need to exit survival mode and move toward stabilization by spring. Start here, and you’ll feel steadier within weeks.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your base:</strong> Pick one: 3 eggs, ¾ cup Greek yogurt, or 1 scoop plant/ whey protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Add whole‑food power:</strong> Include one colorful fruit or veg (spinach, berries, peppers) and a small healthy fat like ¼ avocado or chia seeds.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it fast:</strong> Blend into a smoothie or prep egg muffins overnight — aim to eat within 60 minutes of waking.</li>\n<li><strong>Vegan option:</strong> Blend pea protein, almond milk, spinach, frozen banana, and flax oil.</li>\n<li><strong>Omnivore option:</strong> Scramble eggs with veggies and a sprinkle of cheese or tofu with turmeric if you’d like variety.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Smoother morning energy by day 3‑5, reduced mid‑morning crashes, and a calmer scalp by week 2.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you skip breakfast on busy days or have only coffee, your cortisol spikes back up — batch‑prep portions the night before to stay consistent.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady morning at a time, you’re teaching your body that growth can resume. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron intake and improve how your body absorbs it—so your follicles have the oxygen and nutrients they need to shift from shedding to regrowing.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Heather, because you’re still in the peak shedding phase and your iron has run low before, giving your body a steady iron lift is your “big domino.” It supports recovery from both perimenopausal changes and last year’s restrictive diet, paving the way for stabilization by spring and early regrowth toward September. Think of this as re‑fueling your hair’s energy system from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Anchor one iron-rich meal daily.</strong> Choose lean red meat, lentils, or spinach with a vitamin C source (like peppers or citrus) to boost absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Separate “iron blockers.”</strong> Keep tea, coffee, and calcium supplements at least one hour away from your iron‑rich meals.</li>\n  <li><strong>Include a small protein source each meal.</strong> Eggs, tofu, or beans help stabilize blood sugar and carry iron better into the bloodstream.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track your energy and shedding pattern for two weeks.</strong> More morning energy or slightly less hair on your brush are early clues you’re feeding the cycle again.</li>\n  <li><strong>Optional:</strong> Ask your clinician about checking ferritin if you’ve ever had anemia—seeing your baseline can guide supplementation safely.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less mid‑day fatigue, brighter complexion, and gradually fewer hairs in your morning brush within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals or keeping protein low can stall absorption—set a quick reminder to prep lunch the night before if mornings get rushed.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum, Heather—one nourishing plate at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” means intentionally adding omega‑3‑rich foods—like salmon, sardines, chia, flax, or quality algae oil—to help calm inflammation and support thicker, shinier growth from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Heather, right now you’re in the peak phase—when shedding feels relentless. Because perimenopause and rapid weight loss both deplete essential fatty acids, replenishing omega‑3s is your “big domino.” It steadies hormones, soothes scalp inflammation, and signals your follicles to stay anchored. This small daily change helps move you from chaos toward the stabilization window your body is trying to reach. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your source.</strong> Aim for 2 portions of fatty fish weekly (salmon, sardines, or trout). If you prefer plant-based, use algae oil or a tablespoon of ground flax + chia mix daily.</li>\n<li><strong>Time it with meals.</strong> Pair fats with protein (like eggs or chicken) to boost absorption and keep energy steady through the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it fresh.</strong> Store oils in the fridge and smell before using—any “fishy” scent means oxidation. Skip rancid oils; they stress hair roots instead of helping.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance the ratio.</strong> Reduce excessive seed or fried oils that overload omega‑6s (corn, soybean, sunflower) so the good fats can do their calming work.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your consistency.</strong> Jot down your omega‑3 servings for two weeks—you’ll see steadier moods and smoother skin alongside improved hair quality.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less scalp itching or dryness, steadier energy through the day, and slightly glossier texture within 2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If you often skip breakfast or delay protein till lunch, you’ll miss fat absorption—add your dose to your first solid meal for best results.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each mindful bite is fuel for regrowth. Keep nourishing those roots, one meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your Body So It Can Stop the Shedding Spiral 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Heather, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> — when shedding feels relentless. Because your main triggers — perimenopausal shifts and rapid weight‑loss — are still ongoing, your system is under a lot of hormonal and nutritional strain. This week is about creating safety signals through rhythm and rest. When your body senses consistency again, it begins to quiet the “emergency mode” that’s been pushing hairs out prematurely.</p>\n  <p>With your 6–7 hours of sleep and 2–3 night wakings, anchoring your bedtime and winding down gently are the fastest ways to lower cortisol and stabilize hormone rhythms. Deep, predictable sleep lets estrogen and thyroid signals recalibrate and helps follicles hold onto their strands longer. Even small improvements in bedtime consistency can shift your body from stress response toward repair.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower cortisol spikes:</strong> calmer stress hormones mean fewer follicles pushed into shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> steadier sleep‑wake cycles support perimenopausal balance</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Growth hormone release:</strong> deeper sleep repairs scalp tissue and primes regrowth later</li>\n    <li>🥦 <strong>Metabolic recovery:</strong> steadier rest helps your body use nutrients from meals more effectively</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you protect your sleep window, you tell your body it’s safe to shift from shedding to healing — and that’s how regrowth begins to take root 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
