It’s a gentle way to signal safety to your body before stress or hormones set the tone.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, as you move through your stabilization phase after months of hormonal shifts and a demanding new job, your morning meal is the lever that steadies your system. A high-protein breakfast anchors your blood sugar, curbs emotional eating, and gives your follicles the consistent fuel they need to exit the shedding rhythm and prepare for regrowth by spring 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Prep ahead tonight.</strong> Decide on tomorrow’s breakfast so it’s effortless in the morning — overnight oats with plant protein or Greek yogurt and berries, for example.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance your plate.</strong> Include 25–30 g of protein (2 eggs + tofu scramble + protein shake — any combo works), plus some healthy fats and fiber.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking.</strong> This tells your body it’s safe, reduces reactive hunger, and steadies hormone signals disrupted by stress and hormonal changes.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it fun.</strong> Rotate between vegan (chia pudding with soy milk + nuts) and omnivore (smoked salmon wrap or cottage cheese bowl) so you look forward to it.</li>\n<li><strong>Journal quick wins.</strong> Note stable energy, better focus, or lighter cravings — these are your internal reminders that repair is underway.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More even energy through mid‑morning, fewer sugar crashes, and reduced urge for emotional snacking within one to two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast on busy days — keep high‑protein grab‑and‑go options (boiled eggs, protein smoothie packets) handy to stay consistent.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one steady morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you feed your hair from within by giving your body the nutrients it needs to repair and rebuild strong, steady growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding waves are calming, but new growth still needs fuel to spark.

Because those hormonal shifts are still active and your body is adjusting to a new rhythm, this week is all about creating steadiness from the inside out. Think of it as teaching your system that the storm has passed and it’s safe to hold onto each strand again.</p>\n  <p>Sleep and calm evenings are your biggest levers right now. With your 6–7 hours of rest and fairly consistent bedtimes, anchoring a predictable wind‑down routine helps quiet cortisol and re‑sync hormone signals disrupted by stress and hormonal adjustments. During deep sleep, your body restores growth hormones and repairs follicle cells — the foundation for the regrowth phase forecasted for spring 2026.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calms cortisol spikes:</strong> lowers the “fight or flight” signals that keep follicles in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Restores hormonal rhythm:</strong> steady sleep cues your body to rebalance after contraceptive changes</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Boosts nightly repair:</strong> supports growth hormone release and scalp tissue renewal</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Builds stress resilience:</strong> helps you handle ongoing work pressure without reigniting shedding</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your wind‑down and anchor your sleep, you tell your body it’s safe to regrow — one calm evening at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
