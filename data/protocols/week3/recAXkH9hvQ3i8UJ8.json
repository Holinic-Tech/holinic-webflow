{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” centers your morning around a high‑protein, anti‑inflammatory meal—giving your hormones, energy, and hair follicles the steady fuel they need right from the start.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Gry, since your shedding waves have begun to calm, you’re in the stabilization phase—a time when balanced signals like blood sugar and cortisol reshape how your follicles behave. Because chronic stress and perimenopause are still active triggers, a protein‑anchored breakfast is your “big domino”. It tempers morning stress hormones, steadies energy for your shift work, and sets the stage for stronger regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Decide your protein base:</strong> 2 eggs, ¾ cup Greek yogurt, or a plant power bowl (½ cup cooked lentils + veggies + olive oil).</li>\n  <li><strong>Add color and fiber:</strong> berries, spinach, or leftover roasted veggies calm inflammation and keep blood sugar steady.</li>\n  <li><strong>Include healthy fat:</strong> add a small handful of nuts, a spoon of chia seeds, or half an avocado to slow digestion and extend fullness.</li>\n  <li><strong>Serve within an hour of waking:</strong> this anchors your body clock and reduces mid‑morning cortisol spikes.</li>\n  <li><strong>Prep the night before:</strong> layer ingredients in a jar or container so morning you just grabs, stirs, and eats.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier morning mood and focus, less craving for caffeine after 3 pm, and feeling hungry on schedule instead of “running empty”.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping breakfast or choosing only fruit + coffee can send your cortisol swinging again—quick fix: pair that fruit with protein like boiled eggs or a scoop of yogurt.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds hormonal calm—and every balanced breakfast is one more message to your follicles that safety has returned. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you quietly upgrade each meal so your body has the steady building blocks it needs to calm shedding and spark thicker growth—without strict dieting or complicated plans.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Gry, you’re in the stabilization phase—your follicles are ready to rebuild, but long-term stress and perimenopause shifts can still slow the process.

Omega‑3 rich foods and oils restore that supple, nourished environment where new growth can thrive.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Gry, you’re in the stabilization phase — your follicles are catching their breath after long waves of stress and the hormonal shifts of perimenopause. This is your big domino: feeding your body the right fats helps calm stress chemistry and balance those menopausal and stress‑driven imbalances that kept shedding active. Each omega‑3 meal now becomes soil for the regrowth stage you’re moving toward. 🪴</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Add one palm-sized serving of fatty fish (salmon, trout, sardines, or mackerel) 2–3 times a week.

This week’s focus on rhythm and rest is about telling your body, “the danger has passed.” When that message finally lands, follicles stop loosening prematurely and start preparing for new growth.</p>\n  <p>Because stress has been active for years and your sleep schedule varies by more than an hour most nights (with caffeine still lingering after 3 pm), stabilizing these cues is the single biggest lever you have right now. Deep, regular sleep lowers cortisol, steadies estrogen balance, and restores blood flow to the scalp — all signals your follicles need before they can re‑enter growth mode. Think of each bedtime routine, caffeine boundary, and quiet wind‑down as a micro‑signal of safety to your body.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress hormones:</strong> consistent rest drops cortisol that keeps follicles in “shed” mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> supports perimenopausal balance so shedding waves calm down</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper sleep cycles:</strong> boost nighttime repair and scalp circulation</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Energy recovery:</strong> helps you handle daily stress without reigniting loss</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each evening you protect your sleep and quiet your mind, you’re retraining your body to trust the growth process again — one calm night at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
