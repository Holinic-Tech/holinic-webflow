After years of stress and steady hormonal treatment, breakfast is your “big domino.” A protein-anchored, calm start keeps blood sugar and cortisol stable all morning, helping new strands mature into strong, lasting hair faster. This is where stabilization deepens into visible resilience.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set your morning anchor:</strong> Aim to eat within 60 minutes of waking to ground your hormones for the day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build your 30g protein plate:</strong> Mix any combo such as eggs or Greek yogurt with berries and oats, or a vegan smoothie with plant protein, chia, and spinach.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add calm fuel:</strong> Include one anti‑inflammatory color—like blueberries, turmeric, or leafy greens—to ease invisible stress from inside out.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hydrate before caffeine:</strong> Drink a full glass of water first to rehydrate cells and steady energy.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep it light + joyful:</strong> Prep ingredients the night before so breakfast feels like a win, not a chore.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feel steadier energy mid‑morning, fewer cravings or crashes, and smoother focus.

After years of chronic stress and hormonal load, your body will use every nutrient you give it to rebuild. Since you’re currently getting about one high‑protein meal a day, ensuring balanced plates at every meal is the lever that can turn fragile fuzz into lasting strength. This week, food becomes your most direct message of nourishment to your scalp.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your plate:</strong> Aim for a palm‑sized portion (20–30 g) of protein at each meal—think eggs, salmon, lentils, or tofu.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color:</strong> Fill half your plate with vegetables of at least two colors for antioxidants that protect new hairs from stress damage.</li>\n<li><strong>Healthy fats count:</strong> Include a thumb‑sized serving of avocado, nuts, olive oil, or fatty fish 2–3 times a week to nourish roots.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate rhythmically:</strong> Sip water or herbal tea with every meal; hydration helps carry nutrients to your scalp.</li>\n<li><strong>Evening timing:</strong> Finish dinner at least one hour before bed to support calm digestion and overnight repair.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy through your afternoons, fewer sugar cravings, and a sense of “full but light” after meals.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or relying on caffeine to push through stress can dull your appetite later—set out protein the night before as a quick cue to eat.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each balanced plate is a quiet signal to your body that it’s safe to grow again. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Time Your Food helps you create a gentle gap between your last meal and bedtime, so your body can digest fully and ease into deep, restorative sleep.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Solveig, you’re in the regrowth start phase—shedding has calmed and those new baby hairs show your body’s ready to rebuild. But evening eating just before bed can keep your stress hormones slightly elevated overnight, slowing that repair work. Since ongoing stress has been your main driver, this practice is your “big domino”: it steadies blood sugar and lets nighttime recovery kick in more efficiently to strengthen new growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick a consistent dinner time that ends at least two hours before bed—start with 8 p.m. if you sleep around 10 p.m.</li>\n<li>If you get hungry later, choose a light, protein‑friendly snack (like a handful of nuts or yogurt) instead of a heavy meal.</li>\n<li>Keep caffeine cut-off by early afternoon (you’re already doing well around 12–3 p.m.) and replace late-night nibbling with a calming ritual—herbal tea, light stretch, or reading.</li>\n<li>Note how you feel in the morning: lighter, less bloated, more rested. Those are signs your body’s using the night for repair rather than digestion.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Waking up clearer‑headed, less puffy; falling asleep faster; more balanced energy the next day.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Mindless snacking while scrolling late—pause, have a sip of water, and remind yourself your hair grows best while you rest.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one calm, well‑timed evening at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Time Your Food","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Rebuilding Calm So Growth Can Take the Lead 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Solveig, you’re entering the <strong>regrowth start</strong> phase — that sweet spot where shedding has steadied and baby hairs are beginning to show. Because your main driver, chronic stress, has been ongoing for years, the first focus is helping your body truly feel “off alert.” This week’s practices — steady sleep anchors, gentle wind‑down cues, and a calm bedroom environment — are designed to lock in that foundation.</p>\n  <p>Here’s why this matters now: when your evenings run on calm, your cortisol levels settle, night‑time growth hormones rise, and blood flow to follicles improves. That combination moves your hair cycle from survival to repair. With your moderate stress load and fairly solid 7–8 hours of sleep, even small consistency gains — like keeping bedtimes within 30 minutes — can amplify recovery signals and strengthen those new strands coming in.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets stress hormones:</strong> evening calm lowers cortisol so follicles stay in their growth phase</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances nightly rhythms:</strong> consistent sleep boosts melatonin and growth hormone release</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Improves follicle nutrition:</strong> deeper rest enhances nutrient delivery to the scalp</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Builds resilience:</strong> a predictable routine helps buffer future stress spikes</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your wind‑down and rest window, you teach your body it’s safe to rebuild — one peaceful evening at a time 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
