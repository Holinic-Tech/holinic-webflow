Breakfast protein is your big domino right now: it steadies blood sugar and tells your body it’s safe to grow hair again. This simple anchor meal helps move you from fragile stabilization toward visible regrowth by mid‑2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your breakfast target:</strong> Aim for around 25–30 g of protein within an hour of waking.</li>\n<li><strong>Pick your base:</strong> \n<ul>\n<li><em>Omnivore:</em> 2 eggs + ½ cup Greek yogurt + berries.</li>\n<li><em>Vegan:</em> Smoothie with pea or soy protein (1 scoop), almond butter, spinach, and banana.</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n<li><strong>Add healthy fats & fiber:</strong> A spoon of chia, avocado, or flax keeps inflammation calm.</li>\n<li><strong>Batch-prep:</strong> Boil eggs or portion smoothie bags ahead so your morning stays easy and automatic.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with morning hydration:</strong> 1 glass of water or herbal tea to start your metabolism gently.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer mid‑morning crashes, steadier mood, and less reactive scalp oiliness within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or relying only on coffee (especially after 3 pm) keeps stress hormones high — have a ready‑to‑drink protein shake when mornings feel rushed.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing breakfast at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron intake—through food first—so your body has the building blocks to create strong hair at the root. It also teaches you how to stop everyday habits that quietly block iron absorption.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kelly, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding has slowed but new growth hasn’t yet peaked. Because you’ve had low iron in the past and recently restricted calories, boosting your iron stores is the single biggest lever now. It’s what helps your follicles shift from “pause” to “growth” as your body exits its stress phase and edges toward mid‑2025 regrowth.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Start your day with iron-friendly fuel:</strong> Include one iron‑rich food at breakfast—like oats with pumpkin seeds, eggs with spinach, or lentils blended into a smoothie.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair iron with vitamin C:</strong> Add berries, orange slices, or bell peppers to meals. A small squeeze of lemon over greens can double absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Mind your “iron blockers”:</strong> Keep coffee or tea at least one hour apart from main meals; caffeine after 3 pm already tweaks your sleep, and separating it also protects absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Steady, not strict:</strong> Aim for balanced portions instead of going back to a restrictive plan—your blood and follicles notice those steady calories more than perfection.</li>\n  <li><strong>Track subtle strength gains:</strong> Note brighter face color, more energy climbing stairs, or less lightheadedness—signs your iron bank is filling.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Warmer skin tone, less afternoon fatigue, and slightly fewer shed hairs on your pillow within 2 weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping protein at breakfast after late caffeine undermines this step. Quick fix: prep a high‑protein overnight oat jar and delay caffeine until mid‑morning.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds strength beneath the scalp first—keep showing up for your iron, and your strands will follow. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you increase omega‑3 rich foods so your scalp gets the healthy oils it needs for stronger, shinier hair and calmer shedding.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kelly, you’re in the stabilization phase after a long stretch of worsening shedding. Because perimenopause and restrictive dieting both thin out your essential fats, this simple step is your big domino—restoring the good omegas that quiet inflammation, rebalance hormones, and set the stage for regrowth as spring approaches. Think of it as feeding your follicles the building blocks they’ve been missing.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Pick one daily source:</strong> Add 2–3 servings per week of salmon, sardines, or mackerel. If you don’t like fish, use a spoonful of ground flaxseed or chia daily plus a clean algae oil capsule.</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance the rest of your fats:</strong> Swap butter or other heavy oils for olive or avocado oil when cooking.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check freshness:</strong> When using fish oil or seeds, make sure they smell neutral—not fishy or sour. Rancid oils create the opposite effect on your scalp.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair with protein:</strong> Enjoy your omega‑3 source in a meal containing at least 20–30 g of protein for better absorption and stronger hair fiber support.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stay steady for 3 weeks:</strong> Don’t chase quick results—just keep the habit consistent while your body rebuilds its nutrient reserves.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Slightly less scalp tightness, smoother skin texture, a healthier shine at your roots within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping fat altogether after 3 p.m. (carryover diet habit) can keep hormones flat—add a small portion of nuts or seeds with dinner to fix it.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—one balanced meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your Body After a Long Storm 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Kelly, you’re now in the <em>stabilization phase</em> — the point where your body begins to shift from constant shedding toward recovery. Because your main trigger, perimenopause, is still ongoing and nutrition has been restricted, this week’s focus is to calm internal stress signals and restore steady rhythm through sleep and daily structure. These are the quiet foundations that tell your body it’s safe to stop shedding.</p>\n  <p>Your 6–7 hours of sleep and 2–3 night wakings mean your system hasn’t been getting enough deep repair time. The practices this week — anchoring your bedtime, winding down properly, and cutting caffeine after 3 pm — directly lower cortisol and rebalance the nightly hormone patterns that hair growth depends on. When cortisol drops and growth hormone rises during deep sleep, follicles leave “survival mode” and start preparing for regrowth.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets stress response:</strong> steadier sleep lowers cortisol and inflammation that keep follicles tense</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balances hormones:</strong> supports estrogen and thyroid rhythms disrupted by perimenopause</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Restores nutrient use:</strong> better rest improves how your body absorbs and directs protein and iron toward hair</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deep repair each night:</strong> encourages follicles to shift from shedding into recovery mode</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each evening you protect your wind‑down and caffeine boundary, you’re teaching your body safety — the signal it needs to let shedding settle and prepare for visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
