{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Win Your Day with Breakfast is about starting each morning with a high‑protein, anti‑inflammatory meal so your hair and hormones get steadier energy from the first bite.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, during your peak shedding phase, your perimenopausal hormones and low protein intake are keeping follicles under stress. A strong breakfast gives your body the amino acids and blood‑sugar stability it needs to shift from “breakdown” to “repair.” It’s your big domino — the small daily ritual that helps move you toward mid‑2025 stabilization and eventual regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your base:</strong> Choose one that feels doable daily — e.g., egg scramble with spinach and olive oil, or a vegan smoothie with pea protein and flaxseed.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit 30 g of protein:</strong> Aim for 2 eggs + Greek yogurt or a full scoop (20–30 g) of plant protein powder. More protein in the morning balances glucose all day.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color:</strong> Include one bright fruit or veggie — berries, peppers, greens — for antioxidants that calm scalp inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Make it fast & fun:</strong> Prep ingredients the night before or blend your smoothie as the coffee brews (keep that coffee before 3 pm!).</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> This helps set your cortisol rhythm and keeps shedding‑related stress hormones quieter.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy mid‑morning, fewer sugar cravings by 3 pm, and less overall tension in your scalp within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after a late‑night snack or alcohol can undo the balance you’re building. Quick fix — have a ready‑to‑blend smoothie bag in the freezer.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one calm, nourished morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you boost your iron stores naturally—by adding iron‑rich foods and improving how your body absorbs them—so your scalp and follicles get the oxygen and nutrients they need to grow stronger strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, since you’re in the peak phase and your shedding still feels like it’s worsening, your follicles need every bit of oxygen‑carrying support they can get. Low iron plus perimenopause often keeps hair in a prolonged shed cycle. This week, strengthening your iron intake is your “big domino”: it helps you transition from constant loss toward the stabilization window expected mid‑2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Build one iron anchor meal daily:</strong> Choose red lentils, lean beef, tofu, or spinach cooked in cast‑iron cookware—pair it with vitamin C foods (like lemon, bell pepper, or berries) to boost absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Separate blockers:</strong> Keep tea, coffee, and calcium supplements at least one hour away from these meals so they don’t reduce uptake.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a little “Popeye pair-up”:</strong> Combine plant sources (spinach, beans) with small amounts of meat or fish a few times weekly for a big absorption lift.</li>\n<li><strong>Track energy cues:</strong> Jot how your focus, warmth, or nail color feels over two weeks—early signs your body’s iron balance is improving.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less midday fatigue, warmer hands and feet, and slightly less hair in your comb by the second week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Because you often have dinner right before bed, late caffeine or heavy food can slow digestion—finish the meal by 7 pm when possible so iron absorption and sleep both improve.</li>\n<li>Consistency nourishes your scalp quietly every day—keep going, Mimi, your follicles are listening. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps your body get enough omega‑3s — the anti‑inflammatory fats that calm scalp irritation and support healthy follicles from the inside out. They balance the hormonal shifts of perimenopause and keep new hair seeds nourished as they form.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Mimi, in this peak phase where your shedding still feels strong, your follicles are craving steadier hormone and nutrient signals. Because perimenopause can tilt the balance toward inflammation, adding omega‑3s this week is your big domino — it helps calm that stress chemistry so your scalp can move toward stabilization by mid‑2025 and prepare for regrowth after. Think of this as feeding calm to your follicles.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your source:</strong> Aim for 2 servings per week of fatty fish like salmon, sardines, or trout, or choose an algae‑based omega‑3 supplement if you prefer plant‑based.</li>\n<li><strong>Read the label:</strong> Look for formulas listing both EPA and DHA, totaling at least 1000 mg daily. Avoid bottles that smell fishy — that’s a sign of oxidation.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a healthy partner:</strong> Combine with meals that include colorful veggies and a little olive oil — the vitamin E and antioxidants help the fats work better.</li>\n<li><strong>Store smart:</strong> Keep oils or capsules in the fridge and finish them within the expiry window to avoid rancidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Track how you feel:</strong> Notice if your scalp soreness, dryness, or hot flashes ease slightly after two weeks — those are signals the fats are doing their quiet repair work.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Scalp feels less tight or itchy; morning temp swings settle; skin appears a touch more hydrated.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals or having heavy alcohol nights can blunt the benefits — pair your omega‑3 dose with a balanced meal instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds calm chemistry — keep feeding your follicles steady goodness, one bite of healthy fat at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Creating Calm Inside the Peak Phase 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Mimi, you’re in the <strong>peak phase</strong> — shedding still feels active, but this is the turning point where your system can start to steady. Because your main trigger, <strong>perimenopause</strong>, is ongoing, your hormones are fluctuating daily. That means your body needs clear signals of safety and rhythm — and that’s exactly what this week’s focus on stabilizing sleep and caffeine timing gives you.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your 5–6 hours of broken sleep, late caffeine, and several night wakings are keeping cortisol gently elevated. When cortisol stays high, follicles stay in “wait” mode instead of shifting back into growth. By anchoring your bedtime, winding down earlier, and cutting caffeine after lunch, you help cortisol drop at night, estrogen and progesterone communicate more smoothly, and your scalp’s microcirculation improves — all quiet messages to your follicles that it’s safe to regrow.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets stress hormones:</strong> lowers nighttime cortisol that prolongs shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormone balance:</strong> steadier estrogen–progesterone rhythms signal safety to follicles</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Boosts restorative sleep:</strong> deeper rest triggers growth hormone release for cellular repair</li>\n    <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Improves scalp flow:</strong> better circulation delivers oxygen and nutrients to roots</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you guard your sleep window and sip that last coffee before 2 p.m., you’re telling your body, “we’re safe now.” That’s how shedding slows — and regrowth finds its opening 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
