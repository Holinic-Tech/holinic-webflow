{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” means starting your morning with a protein-rich meal that’s quick, satisfying, and keeps your energy steady. Think of it as fueling your body (and scalp) before the day gets away from you.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>You’re in the stabilization phase—shedding has stopped escalating but regrowth hasn’t begun yet. Right now stress is still the main stopper, and with only one protein-rich meal a day, your hair is missing key building blocks. Making breakfast your anchor meal is your “big domino”: it calms stress swings, steadies your energy, and supplies roots with the nutrients they’ll need for regrowth to start. This is how you get momentum moving toward baby hairs. 🌱</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Pick a fast base: scrambled eggs, Greek yogurt, tofu scramble, or a simple smoothie.</li>\n    <li>Add 20–30g protein: 2–3 eggs, a scoop of plant protein powder, or a cup of lentils/beans.</li>\n    <li>Layer in healthy extras: berries, spinach, avocado, or oats for balanced fuel.</li>\n    <li>Keep it fun: swap flavors daily—savory one day (eggs + veggies), creamy smoothie the next.</li>\n    <li>Prep in advance if mornings are hectic (overnight oats, chia puddings with protein powder).</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More steady energy through the morning, fewer mid-morning crashes, and less urgent cravings for sugar or caffeine.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Doom scrolling late at night can delay your sleep, making it harder to wake with the appetite (and time) for breakfast. Quick fix: set a phone cut-off and prep your breakfast the night before so it’s waiting.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing morning at a time, your scalp will feel the difference. 🌅</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"```html\n<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” is about upgrading your daily meals so your body gets the raw materials it needs to build strong, healthy hair from the inside out.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Toby, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has stopped spiking but baby hairs haven’t yet appeared. Because stress is still ongoing and your protein is usually just one solid meal a day, your follicles may be waiting for more steady fuel. Shifting your plate now is your big domino: once your body feels supported, it can transition from merely holding ground into starting visible regrowth in the coming months.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>At breakfast, add 20–30 g of protein — for example, two eggs with Greek yogurt, or a protein smoothie with oats and nut butter.</li>\n    <li>At lunch and dinner, make half your plate colorful vegetables, a palm-sized portion of protein, and a thumb-sized serving of healthy fats (like avocado or olive oil).</li>\n    <li>Include iron- and zinc-rich foods at least three times weekly — lean red meat, lentils, pumpkin seeds, or chickpeas.</li>\n    <li>Boost omega-3s by adding salmon, sardines, or a chia/flax pudding once or twice a week.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling steadier energy through the day, less intense sugar cravings, and fewer episodes of lightheadedness within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals during stressful days can undo your progress. Quick fix: keep protein snacks (nuts, boiled eggs, edamame) ready so you don’t miss the window.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — each balanced plate signals safety to your body, helping hair roots shift from survival to regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>\n```","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Eat More Good Fats” is about lifting the quality of your daily fuel — adding omega‑3 rich foods and safe sources of healthy fats so your scalp and follicles have what they need to repair and regrow.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Toby, you’re in the stabilization phase: shedding has steadied but regrowth hasn’t kicked in yet. With stress still present, your body is burning through reserves faster, and low omega‑3 intake (only a couple times a month) leaves your scalp under‑supplied. This one change is your big domino — nourishing your system so it has the raw building blocks to shift from “just holding on” into early regrowth. Think of it as feeding calm and resilience straight to your roots.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose 2 main omega‑3 anchors: e.g., salmon, sardines, trout, or algae‑based oil if plant‑only.</li>\n    <li>Aim to eat one serving (about palm‑sized for fish or 1–2 tsp of oil) at least 3 times this week.</li>\n    <li>If supplementing, pick a fresh, high‑quality oil (check there’s no “fishy” or rancid smell).</li>\n    <li>Balance fats: swap processed seed oils or fried foods for olive oil, avocado, or nuts as your everyday base.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> skin feels less dry, mood steadies on stressful days, and digestion is calmer within a week or two.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> on busy nights you may default to doom‑scrolling with a snack that’s just carbs — fix this by keeping tins of sardines or a bag of walnuts within reach for an easy swap.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing meal at a time will be the bridge from stabilization to regrowth. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats"}}
