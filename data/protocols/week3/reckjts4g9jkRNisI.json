Because stress is still in your picture, anchoring breakfast is a simple, daily win that nudges your system toward resilience and stronger hair.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Within an hour of waking, plan a breakfast with ~25–30g protein.</li>\n    <li>Pick a go‑to option: scrambled eggs + avocado toast, Greek yogurt with berries, or a smoothie with protein powder.</li>\n    <li>Prefer plant‑based? Try tofu scramble, overnight oats with hemp hearts, or a chia‑seed pudding boosted with pea protein.</li>\n    <li>Keep it fast: batch‑prep two breakfast choices on Sunday so weekday mornings feel effortless.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less mid‑morning crash, steadier focus by day 7, feeling fuller until lunch by week two.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast if you wake up rushed — quick fix: prep grab‑and‑go jars the night before so you don’t default to nothing.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” means using simple food shifts to feed your follicles what they’re missing, so your strands can emerge stronger and stay anchored longer.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Toby, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding isn’t escalating, and baby hairs are already showing.

This is a hopeful sign that your follicles are waking back up. But because your main ongoing trigger is chronic stress, your system still needs a clear signal of safety. That’s why this week focuses on sleep and nervous system stability: it’s the fastest way to quiet stress hormones so your scalp can stay in recovery mode.</p>\n  <p>Right now you’re averaging 6–7 hours of sleep with two to three night wakings. That broken rhythm keeps cortisol active and limits deep, restorative sleep — the very window when growth hormones rise and repair signals reach your follicles. By anchoring a consistent bedtime, winding down with calm rituals, and shaping your bedroom into a true rest space, you give your body the nightly reset it needs to shift from “shedding survival” into “regrowth support.”</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol quieting:</strong> lowers the stress signal that keeps follicles stuck in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal rhythm reset:</strong> steadies sleep–wake cycles so growth signals can fire at night</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Growth hormone access:</strong> deep sleep unlocks repair and fuels the next wave of baby hairs</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Stress resilience:</strong> builds a buffer so ongoing life pressures don’t keep hair in limbo</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your sleep, you’re not just resting — you’re teaching your body it’s safe to grow again 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
