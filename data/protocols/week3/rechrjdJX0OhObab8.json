Low protein intake, spotty nutrition, and late meals before short nights are keeping your system from moving into stabilization. The “plate tweak” is your big domino here: giving your follicles the raw materials (protein, iron, omega‑3s) to shorten the lag and set up regrowth once shedding slows. 🌱</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Aim for protein at <strong>all 3 meals</strong> (20–30 g each)</li> \n<li>Add omega‑3 source 2–3x/week (salmon, sardines, chia, or flax)</li> \n<li>Build iron‑rich plates with beans, spinach, lentils, lean meats</li> \n<li>Pair plants + vitamin C (peppers, citrus) to absorb iron better</li> \n<li>Shift your last meal a bit earlier (2–3 hrs before bed) for deeper sleep</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"practice-plan\"> \n<h4>Your plan</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Breakfast (anchor):</strong> Greek yogurt parfait with berries + chia</li> \n<li><strong>Lunch:</strong> Lentil & spinach soup + slice of whole‑grain toast</li> \n<li><strong>Dinner:</strong> Grilled salmon, quinoa, roasted broccoli</li> \n<li>If late hunger hits: small protein snack (boiled egg, edamame) instead of a full meal</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Start tomorrow with a protein‑forward breakfast (≥25 g).</li> \n<li>Batch cook 1–2 iron/omega‑3 rich meals on Sunday to reduce weeknight friction.</li> \n<li>Keep vitamin C fruit/veg handy—add them wherever you eat beans/greens.</li> \n<li>Set a “last bite” cutoff ~2 hrs before intended sleep; prep a lighter snack option if needed.</li> \n<li>If late caffeine cravings strike, sub green tea (earlier) or herbal tea (after 3 pm).</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because sleep is <5 hrs/night, deeper nutrition helps blunt cortisol and preserves protein stores that hair needs while your sleep stabilizes.</li> \n<li>Your peak shedding (~Sep–Oct) reflects lag from July + illness. Adequate protein/iron shortens time‑to‑stabilization so regrowth can begin on schedule.</li> \n<li>Irregular periods suggest possible iron risk—even without heavy flow.
