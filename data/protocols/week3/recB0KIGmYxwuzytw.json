{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” is about starting each morning with a solid, protein‑anchored meal so your energy, mood, and hormones stay steady — and your hair gets the early nutrients it needs to rebuild.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marin, you’re in the stabilization phase — the critical middle ground where your follicles are trying to find their rhythm again after months of medication shifts and long‑term stress. A balanced, high‑protein breakfast is your big domino right now: it steadies morning blood sugar and cortisol, which keeps shedding calm and creates the hormonal balance needed for regrowth to begin by mid‑2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set a breakfast window:</strong> Eat within 60–90 minutes of waking to quickly fuel your body and reduce stress hormone spikes.</li>\n<li><strong>Build your plate:</strong> Aim for at least 25–30 g of protein. Try Greek yogurt with berries and chia, or a veggie omelet with avocado. For vegan days, blend tofu or pea‑protein powder into a smoothie with oats and nut butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Add an anti‑inflammatory twist:</strong> Sprinkle cinnamon, turmeric, or a handful of walnuts to calm inflammation from ongoing stress.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it doable:</strong> Meal‑prep protein muffins or overnight oats so even busy mornings don’t pull you off track on high‑stress days.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy before lunch, fewer sugar crashes, and less morning shedding during brushing within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or grabbing a sugary pastry when rushing can spike cortisol — if that happens, pair a quick protein bar with fruit instead of skipping altogether.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing morning at a time. 🌞 Your follicles feel every small win you feed them.</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you quietly upgrade your everyday meals so they feed your hair the steady nutrients it’s been missing — especially the protein and healthy fats that anchor growth from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marin, you’re in the stabilization phase, right after a long stretch of stress and a medication change. Your scalp is ready to rest and rebuild, but it needs consistent nourishment to do that. Because you usually have just one high‑protein meal a day and rarely eat fatty fish, this tweak becomes your big domino — it can calm ongoing shedding faster and prepare your follicles for your upcoming regrowth window around June. Think of food as your quiet recovery signal.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start breakfast with protein.</strong> Aim for 25–30 g: think eggs with Greek yogurt, or a protein smoothie blended with nut butter and spinach.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color and healthy fat at lunch or dinner.</strong> Include a drizzle of olive oil, avocado, or a handful of walnuts to keep anti‑inflammatory nutrients flowing.</li>\n<li><strong>Level up your omega‑3 intake.</strong> Plan two servings of salmon, sardines, or trout each week — or use an algae‑oil supplement if you prefer plant‑based options.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a “hair plate.”</strong> Half vegetables, a palm‑size protein portion, quarter whole grains or legumes, and small fats on the side. No need for perfection — just gentle repetition.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate consciously.</strong> One extra glass of water with each meal helps your body transport those nutrients to the roots.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier energy, less afternoon sugar craving, and slightly softer new hair texture within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> doom‑scrolling during dinner often leads to forgetting protein — set your phone aside and savor the meal.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — each balanced plate is a quiet message to your body that the shedding storm is passing. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats is about gently nudging your meals toward omega‑3–rich foods, like salmon, sardines, chia, or algae oil, while watching for low‑quality or rancid fats that quietly stress your system. These healthy oils calm inflammation and help your scalp environment feel “safe” again for new growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marin, you’re in the stabilization phase — your follicles are tired from chronic stress and a recent medication shift. This step is your big domino because nourishing fats signal safety and repair from the inside out. Feeding your body steady omega‑3s now helps shorten the lag between stabilization and the first visible regrowth around early summer. Think of this as quiet scaffolding for the new sprouts to rise. 🌿</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your anchor source:</strong> Aim for two servings weekly of fatty fish (salmon, trout, sardines) or add 1 tsp chia or ground flax to breakfast daily.</li>\n<li><strong>Upgrade your oil:</strong> Use cold‑pressed olive or avocado oil for cooking; keep omega‑3 capsules or algae oil refrigerated and replace if they smell “fishy” or sharp — that means rancid.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair fats with protein:</strong> Include a source of 20–30 g protein in the same meal to help your follicles actually use the fats you eat.</li>\n<li><strong>Reduce competing fats:</strong> Limit vegetable oils high in omega‑6 (sunflower, corn, soybean); they crowd out the calming fats you’re adding.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay consistent for 21 days:</strong> Track how often your meals include an omega‑3 source — progress beats perfection.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Smoother scalp comfort, slightly less itch or dryness, and steadier energy by mid‑afternoon—these show your inflammation is easing.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping meals during busy, stressed days or doom‑scrolling late and forgetting dinner can erase your fat intake. Quick fix: prep a small “omega pack” (nuts + chia pudding) before work.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Your Stabilization Window: Calming the Cycle 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Marin, you’re now in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — the stretch where shedding steadies after last year’s peak. Because your <strong>medication change (Aug 2024)</strong> is still active and stress has been ongoing, this week is about sending your body one clear message: it’s safe to stop the stress response that keeps follicles on alert.</p>\n  <p>The practices ahead — anchoring consistent sleep, winding down properly, and pausing alcohol — target the same system that’s been driving your shedding: cortisol and nervous‑system tension. Even though you sleep 7–8 hours, the variable bedtimes and late‑week drinks can keep stress hormones slightly elevated. Locking in rhythm helps your follicles re‑enter calm, oxygen‑rich growth phases and sets the stage for the regrowth window expected around <strong>June 2025</strong>.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Steadier cortisol:</strong> lowers daily stress signals so follicles can shift out of “shed mode.”</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> supports more regular cycles and balanced scalp oil production.</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper nightly repair:</strong> boosts growth‑related hormones released during early sleep hours.</li>\n    <li>💧 <strong>Reduced inflammation:</strong> gives your scalp a calmer environment for regrowth to begin.</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you anchor your bedtime and skip that extra drink, you’re teaching your body that it’s safe to grow again — one peaceful evening closer to stronger strands and visible recovery 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
