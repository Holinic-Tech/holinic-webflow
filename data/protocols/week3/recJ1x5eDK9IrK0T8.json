High‑protein breakfasts calm the cortisol surges that keep shedding stuck in “on” mode. Pairing this step with better sleep hours (you average 5–6) is your big domino to move from fragile recovery to real regrowth over the next few months.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Set your goal:</strong> Aim for 25–30 g of protein within one hour of waking—this anchors blood sugar and hormone rhythm for the day.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pick your base:</strong> \n    <ul>\n      <li>Omnivore: 2 eggs + ½ cup Greek yogurt, or a turkey wrap with avocado.</li>\n      <li>Vegan: Tofu scramble with spinach, or a smoothie with pea protein and almond butter.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Add color:</strong> Include one antioxidant fruit or veg—berries, tomatoes, or leafy greens keep inflammation down.</li>\n  <li><strong>Batch or prep:</strong> Hard‑boil eggs, pre‑blend smoothie bags, or portion overnight oats so the choice feels effortless even on rushed mornings.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check‑in:</strong> After a week or two, notice energy steadiness mid‑morning; tweak snacks only if hunger hits early.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Smoother energy flow by 10 a.m., fewer cravings for comfort foods, and a subtle lift in focus and mood within 7–10 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If late caffeine steals your morning appetite, set a “last cup” boundary at 2 p.m.—your sleep and breakfast rhythm will both thank you.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—one balanced morning plate at a time. 🌞</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron levels through food and habits your body can actually use, while avoiding things that block absorption.

Because you’ve had low iron before and still eat just one high‑protein meal a day, this step is your “big domino.” Restoring steady iron helps your baby hairs mature instead of shedding too soon, guiding you toward that regrowth window around mid‑2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start the day iron‑first:</strong> Include a source like eggs, chicken, lean red meat, lentils, or spinach within your first meal. Pair with vitamin C (orange slices, bell pepper, or kiwi) to boost absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Spread your protein:</strong> Add 20 – 30 g of protein to lunch and dinner so your scalp gets an all‑day mineral supply.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind the blockers:</strong> Keep coffee, tea, and high‑calcium foods at least one hour away from iron‑rich meals.</li>\n<li><strong>Add one “iron helper” snack:</strong> A boiled egg or pumpkin seeds mid‑afternoon keeps energy stable and reduces emotional‑eating dips.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your cues:</strong> Jot down energy levels and how often you feel cold or light‑headed—early signs of progress come from inside before you see them on your scalp.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Brighter morning energy, steadier moods, and less dizziness within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Late‑day coffee after 3 pm blunts iron uptake—swap for herbal tea instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Calm Your Scalp and Body teaches you how to settle your nervous system when stress spikes, so your scalp and hair can move from “alarm mode” into true repair.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Rochelle, you’re in the stabilization phase—your baby hairs show recovery is underway, but chronic stress is still pressing on the brake.
