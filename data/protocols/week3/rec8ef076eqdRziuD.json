You’ll build a simple, protein-rich breakfast routine that fuels stable energy, steadier moods, and stronger hair growth signals all day long.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, your body has weathered a long stretch of physical recovery from your injury, and you’re now moving through the stabilization phase toward regrowth. Morning protein is the single biggest lever to help your follicles regain rhythm and strength after the stress waves. Anchoring your day with it steadies hormones that guide your hair from survival mode into steady renewal.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your base:</strong> Aim for ~30 g protein within an hour of waking. Try 2 eggs with sautéed spinach, or a scoop of plant protein blended with almond milk and oats for a vegan option.</li>\n<li><strong>Add anti-inflammatory color:</strong> Include berries, kiwi, or a handful of greens. Their antioxidants buffer lingering stress chemistry still clearing from your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance with healthy fats:</strong> Add avocado slices, chia pudding, or a drizzle of olive oil — smooth energy keeps blood sugar steady through late morning.</li>\n<li><strong>Pick two go‑to recipes:</strong> Rotate them, so it’s fast and automatic even on busy days. Prep dry ingredients the night before.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay hydrated:</strong> Pair breakfast with water or herbal tea to gently wake circulation and scalp perfusion.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy before lunch, fewer mid‑morning sugar cravings, and slightly calmer scalp shedding within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or grabbing only carbs (like toast or cereal) can spike cortisol and delay stabilization; quick fix — keep protein powder or boiled eggs on standby.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, one nourishing morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you gently upgrade everyday meals so your hair gets the nutrients it needs—without dieting or strict tracking. It’s about small, tasty swaps that make your scalp a more fertile ground for growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding waves are easing, and your body’s next job is to rebuild. After months of recovery from injury and stress, your system’s nutrient stores may be low. Nourishing from the inside out now is your big domino: it steadies hormone signals and prepares strong regrowth when your new roots wake up around May 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Build your foundation plate:</strong> At lunch and dinner, fill ½ your plate with colorful vegetables, ¼ with high‑quality protein (chicken, lentils, eggs, tofu), and ¼ with slow carbs (quinoa, sweet potato, oats).</li>\n<li><strong>Add healthy fats daily:</strong> Include a thumb‑size serving of avocado, olive oil, nuts, or seeds with each meal—these deliver vitamin E and healthy oils that support scalp balance.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost omega‑3s twice a week:</strong> Enjoy salmon, sardines, or add a teaspoon of algae oil to smoothies to help calm inflammation still lingering from your injury recovery.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate with purpose:</strong> Aim for steady water intake through the day; even mild dehydration can slow nutrient delivery to follicles.</li>\n<li><strong>Treat breakfast as “fuel for growth”:</strong> Keep at least 20–30 g of protein before noon to anchor blood‑sugar balance and feed new keratin production.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More steady energy across your day, fewer cravings after lunch, and a healthier scalp texture (less dryness or flaking) within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping meals when you’re busy can shortchange your protein target—prep extra portions in advance so nutrition stays effortless.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds stronger roots, meal by meal. You’re feeding tomorrow’s shine today. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you restore your scalp’s calm and flexibility by bringing in real omega‑3s from food. These healthy fats quiet inflammation, support hormone balance, and create the smooth foundation new hair needs to grow strong.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katelynn, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding waves are finally easing after that long injury period earlier this year. Right now, your follicles are repairing, and omega‑3s act like a soothing oil change for your scalp. Since you only eat fatty fish once or twice a month, this is your “big domino”: bringing in more good fats now will help lock down the calm that lets regrowth begin by spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Include one rich omega‑3 food at least four times this week — salmon, sardines, mackerel, or trout. If you prefer plant options, add a tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia daily.</li>\n<li>When using a supplement, check freshness: no “fishy burp,” and store capsules away from light and heat to avoid rancidity.</li>\n<li>Pair omega‑3s with colorful vegetables or a squeeze of lemon — antioxidants keep the fats working cleanly in your system.</li>\n<li>Cut back on fried or ultra‑processed oils (soy, corn, seed mixes) that can crowd out the benefits of the good fats.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or itchy, skin around your hairline softens, and post‑wash shedding clumps shrink within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping healthy fats on busy days — prep quick options (canned salmon or chia puddings) so your intake stays steady.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds strength from within — keep feeding those roots daily, and they’ll repay you quietly, strand by strand. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Helping Your Body Feel Safe Again 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Katelynn, you’re now in the stabilization phase — the point where your body moves from reacting to rebuilding. After months of shedding waves triggered by your injury and blood loss earlier this year, your system is finally getting the message that the danger has passed.
