Because your main trigger, chronic stress, is still ongoing, this week is all about helping your body feel consistently safe again. That’s what turns “occasional good days” into a steady foundation for recovery.</p>\n  <p>The practices you’ll focus on — anchoring your sleep, winding down properly, and optimizing your bedroom — are small daily signals that tell your nervous system it can drop its guard. When stress hormones like cortisol stay high, follicles stay on alert. But when you restore calm and deepen sleep, cortisol drops, growth hormones rise, and nutrient delivery to the scalp improves. With your 6–7 hours of mostly solid rest, adding a true wind‑down routine is the big domino that will help you shift from reactive to restorative mode.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress load:</strong> steadier cortisol helps halt the “shed” signal at the root</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm repair:</strong> regular sleep–wake cues rebalance your daily hormonal flow</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper recovery sleep:</strong> boosts nighttime growth hormone and follicle repair</li>\n    <li>💧 <strong>Better nutrient use:</strong> calmer digestion means more protein and minerals reach your hair</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep and calm your system, you’re shortening the stress loop and strengthening the ground for new growth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
