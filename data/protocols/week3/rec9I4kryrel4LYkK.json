{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” helps you start your morning with a steady, protein‑rich meal so your energy, mood, and hair growth signals stay balanced all day. It’s about fueling—not restricting—your body first thing.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kinga, you’re in the early regrowth phase—those baby hairs you noticed months ago are proof your follicles are waking back up. Since low iron was one of your past triggers and you currently eat only one high‑protein meal a day, adding morning protein is your “big domino.” It steadies blood sugar and supports iron use, driving you from recovery into stronger, thicker strands this season.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Plan the night before.</strong> Decide what you’ll eat for breakfast—set out ingredients or prep the base to remove morning friction.</li>\n<li><strong>Target 25–30g of protein.</strong> Examples: two eggs with avocado toast and spinach, or a vegan smoothie with pea protein, oats, and berries.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color and balance.</strong> Include at least one fiber‑rich or anti‑inflammatory food (e.g., blueberries, flaxseed, greens).</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking.</strong> A consistent morning meal trains your cortisol rhythm, easing mid‑morning dips and stress‑related shedding.</li>\n<li><strong>Notice how you feel.</strong> Check energy, focus, and hunger—small awareness wins build long‑term consistency.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Feeling more satisfied mid‑morning, steadier energy through workouts, stronger nails or less afternoon snacking within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after a short night of sleep can spike stress hormones and derail consistency. Quick fix: prep a 60‑second smoothie instead of skipping.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum, just like your new growth does—one nourishing morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise iron intake through everyday meals while minimizing habits that block absorption, so your scalp gets the oxygen‑rich blood it needs to grow stronger strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kinga, your shedding began about 6–12 months ago, and since you’ve already spotted baby hairs, you’re right at the doorway of regrowth. Because low iron was an earlier roadblock, this protocol is your “big domino” now — it ensures those new hairs aren’t just sprouting but actually thickening through the next growth cycle. What you do in these weeks sets the foundation for lasting strength after your recent stabilization phase.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add an iron‑rich anchor meal daily.</strong> Think lean beef, chicken thigh, lentils, or spinach with a squeeze of lemon — aim for one serving every day.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with vitamin C.</strong> Add peppers, citrus, or berries alongside your iron foods; this can double absorption naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Space out blockers.</strong> Keep coffee, tea, or calcium supplements at least one hour away from main iron meals.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep protein steady.</strong> Combine this with your <em>Protein 30 Breakfast</em> focus — iron rides best with a regular flow of amino acids.</li>\n<li><strong>Track how you feel.</strong> Note energy, nail color, and scalp warmth; they often improve even before visible hair density does.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Brighter face color, steadier morning energy, and slightly warmer fingers or toes within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping meals or leaning on caffeine too close to lunch can reduce absorption — fix it with a mid‑morning snack and limit coffee to before noon.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one well‑nourished meal at a time. You’re feeding the foundation of every new strand. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you gently boost the healthy omega‑3s that steady your hormones and nourish new hair roots from the inside out. These fats build stronger cell membranes in your scalp and lower the quiet inflammation that can keep hair in “rest” mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Kinga, you’re in the early regrowth stage — baby hairs are already appearing, which means your follicles are waking up. Since low iron was once a driver, now your next “big domino” is the balance of your fats. Because you eat fish only once or twice a month, adding quality omega‑3s right now helps those new hairs thicken faster and stabilize your recovery through the coming winter cycle.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Add one omega‑3 source daily.</strong> Choose 1 Tbsp of ground flax or chia, a handful of walnuts, or a small portion of salmon/sardines 2–3 times per week.</li>\n  <li><strong>If using supplements, buy fresh.</strong> Pick a certified‑pure fish or algae oil stored in the fridge; smell it — if it’s “fishy,” it’s rancid and doing the opposite of healing.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair with color foods.</strong> Eat your fats with something bright (tomato, spinach, berries). The antioxidants keep oils stable and make your scalp cells more resilient.</li>\n  <li><strong>Cut the over‑fried oils.</strong> Limit vegetable oils from chips or take‑out; they raise the omega‑6:3 ratio that stalls regrowth.</li>\n  <li><strong>Be consistent 21 days.</strong> Track in the notes on your phone — one small portion a day beats a burst once a week.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Softer scalp skin within 10 days, fewer wiry ends, and a slight “sheen” returning to new baby hairs.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or delaying meals — it blunts absorption of these fats; quick fix: take omega‑3s with your first bite of protein in the morning.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — every spoon of good fat today is feeding tomorrow’s thicker strands. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering Your Body for Stronger Regrowth 🌿</h4>\n  <p>You’re entering the early regrowth phase — that exciting moment when shedding slows and baby hairs start to thicken.
