At this point, your follicles need consistent, nourishing fuel to build stronger strands. Because perimenopausal shifts can still wobble hormones, a protein-centered breakfast is your daily stabilizer. It keeps stress hormones calm, blood sugar even, and supports the steady growth that carries you through this new chapter of recovery.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Choose your base:</strong> Aim for 25–30 g of protein. Examples: 2 eggs + Greek yogurt, or a vegan combo of tofu scramble and chia pudding.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color:</strong> Include at least one handful of berries, spinach, or peppers — antioxidants soothe inflammation that can slow regrowth.</li>\n<li><strong>Layer healthy fats:</strong> Sprinkle walnuts, hemp seeds, or avocado for hormone support and shine.</li>\n<li><strong>Prep fast:</strong> Batch-cook boiled eggs or a tofu mix on Sundays, so mornings stay effortless.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> This gently resets cortisol rhythms and improves nutrient absorption through the day.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice steadier mid-morning energy, calmer appetite, and fewer afternoon slumps within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast for coffee alone — it spikes cortisol and delays your hormone balance. Quick fix: even a 5‑minute grab‑and‑go smoothie with protein powder and fruit counts.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you fill gentle nutrition gaps so new hair can grow stronger and stay anchored. It’s about simple, satisfying changes — not restriction.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Paola, you’ve already turned the corner — shedding has slowed and baby hairs are sprouting. At this early regrowth stage, your follicles need steady, nutrient-rich fuel. Because you rarely eat fatty fish, adjusting your plate now gives those new hairs the essential proteins and omega fats to mature through your next cycles of perimenopausal change and move you into lasting stabilization.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your protein:</strong> Keep those two protein-rich meals, and add one 20–25 g source (like eggs, lentils, or yogurt) at breakfast or snacks to reach three balanced hits per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a color boost:</strong> At lunch and dinner, fill half your plate with vibrant veggies — spinach, sweet peppers, or broccoli — for iron and antioxidants that protect fragile new strands.</li>\n<li><strong>Feed your fats:</strong> Include omega-3 sources at least three times weekly — salmon, sardines, chia pudding, or flax added to oats — to calm follicle inflammation.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep rhythm with meals:</strong> Aim for consistent timing across days; your hormones love predictability, and your hair does too.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> A steadier appetite, reduced mid-day energy dips, and fewer “snappy” baby hairs within 10–14 days show your plate is feeding follicle stability.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping lunch after workouts (your main stress outlet) can blunt regrowth; fix it by pre‑packing protein snacks for post‑exercise recovery.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — every balanced plate gives your new growth a stronger foundation. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you nourish your scalp from the inside out by bringing in steady omega‑3s — the anti‑inflammatory fats that calm shedding signals and thicken renewing strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>You’re in the early regrowth phase, Paola — shedding is calming and those baby hairs show your follicles are ready to rebuild. But perimenopausal shifts can still cause tiny flare‑ups. Adding omega‑3s now gives your scalp the raw materials to balance those hormones and seal in this recovery window, keeping progress steady toward fuller texture through 2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li>Pick two main sources: try a salmon or sardine meal twice this week, or take an algae or fish oil supplement with at least 500 mg combined EPA + DHA per day.</li>\n<li>Keep bottles cool and sealed — discard any supplement that smells fishy or “off,” as rancid oils create the opposite effect.</li>\n<li>Balance the rest of your fats: swap seed oils for olive or avocado oil when cooking, and add a few walnuts or chia seeds to snacks.</li>\n<li>Stay consistent for four weeks before judging results — consistency builds your scalp’s reservoir of healthy fats.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or flaky within two weeks; hair shaft static reduces; new baby hairs lie smoother around your crown.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping fats at breakfast — this delays absorption. Quick fix: pair your morning coffee with a small handful of nuts or a boiled egg.</li>\n<li>Every nourishing bite is a quiet signal to your scalp: “We’re safe to grow again.” Keep feeding that message daily. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Grounding Your Body So Regrowth Can Take the Lead 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Paola, you’re now in the early <strong>regrowth phase</strong> — the shedding has eased, and those new baby hairs you’ve spotted are proof that your follicles are waking back up. Because your main trigger, <strong>perimenopause-related hormonal change</strong>, is still ongoing, this week is about helping your body feel steady and safe so growth can keep progressing without new setbacks.</p>\n  <p>Your sleep habits are already strong — a steady 7–8 hours, consistent bedtimes, and minimal night wakings. That’s a huge advantage. The practices this week — anchoring your sleep window, winding down properly, and fine-tuning your bedroom — are the “big domino” that keeps cortisol low and supports healthy estrogen and progesterone rhythms. When these rhythms stay balanced, follicles hold onto hair longer and new growth can thicken more easily.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Deep nervous system calm:</strong> reinforces the safety signal that tells follicles to stay in growth mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm support:</strong> steadier sleep-wake patterns buffer the ups and downs of perimenopause</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Improved nutrient use:</strong> restful nights help your body direct protein and minerals toward rebuilding strands</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Nighttime recovery:</strong> deeper sleep boosts growth hormone, which repairs scalp tissue and follicle strength</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each calm, consistent night you protect your rest, you’re signaling your body that it’s safe to keep growing — one peaceful sleep at a time 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
