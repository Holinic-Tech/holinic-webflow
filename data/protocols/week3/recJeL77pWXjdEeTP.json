{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p><em>Win Your Day with Breakfast</em> is a morning reset that starts your metabolism gently and feeds your follicles with real fuel — steady protein and calm blood sugar — before the day’s stress hormones wake up fully.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, you’re in your stabilization phase — the storm has eased, and baby hairs are already pushing through. Because chronic stress and perimenopause both nudge hormones off balance, a solid protein‑first breakfast is your biggest domino right now. It steadies cortisol and insulin, protecting new growth and helping you move from fragile regrowth toward thicker, anchored strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Eat within 60 minutes of waking.</strong> Aim for 25–30 g of protein — about a palm‑sized portion.</li>\n  <li><strong>Build your breakfast base:</strong> choose one smart combo such as:\n    <ul>\n      <li><em>Omnivore:</em> 2 eggs + ½ cup cottage cheese + berries + chia sprinkle.</li>\n      <li><em>Vegan:</em> tofu scramble with spinach + hemp seeds over oat‑free porridge.</li>\n    </ul>\n  </li>\n  <li><strong>Add a healthy fat</strong> (¼ avocado or 1 Tbsp nut butter) to blunt mid‑morning cravings.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hydrate before coffee.</strong> One large glass of water signals safety to your stress system and kick‑starts digestion.</li>\n  <li><strong>Repeat daily.</strong> Consistency trains hormones faster than intensity — think rhythm, not perfection.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier energy till lunch, fewer sugar crashes, and calmer mood within a week.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast while doom scrolling can spike cortisol again — set your phone aside and eat screen‑free for 10 minutes.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced breakfast at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Popeye Protocol helps you rebuild your iron stores through simple, food-based routines so your scalp and follicles get the oxygen and nutrients they need to stay strong and grow new strands.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Jet, you’re in your stabilization phase—your shedding has eased and those baby hairs you noticed months ago are proof your follicles are trying to re‑enter growth. But low iron can quietly hold them back, especially after years of hormonal shifts and stress that deplete reserves. This is your “big domino”: with steady iron nourishment, those fragile new hairs can thicken and stay put through the months ahead toward regrowth.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li><strong>Start your day with iron + C:</strong> Add 1 iron‑rich food at breakfast—like eggs with spinach, oatmeal with pumpkin seeds, or a small beef patty—and pair it with fruit rich in vitamin C (kiwi, berries, or orange slices) to boost absorption.</li>\n    <li><strong>Lunch or dinner anchor:</strong> Include a palm‑sized portion of protein (lean meat, lentils, tofu, or tempeh) and dark greens at least once daily; drizzle with olive oil or lemon to aid absorption.</li>\n    <li><strong>Separate inhibitors:</strong> Keep coffee, tea, or calcium supplements at least an hour away from high‑iron meals so they don’t block uptake.</li>\n    <li><strong>Track energy and color:</strong> Note changes in energy, nail pinkness, or fewer light‑headed spells—they’re subtle markers of improvement inside, long before new length shows.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Within 1–2 weeks, steadier afternoon energy and less “crash” between meals; by week 3, smoother hair texture or fewer short breakages.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Doom‑scrolling at night can delay rest and blunt iron absorption by keeping stress hormones high—set a gentle phone cutoff 30 minutes before bed.</li>\n    <li>Consistency compounds quietly—each nourishing meal is a vote for stronger roots. Keep at it, one bite and one calm evening at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you build healthier cell membranes and calmer inflammation by getting enough omega‑3s from food or supplements. When these fats show up daily, they nourish your scalp’s microcirculation and the follicles that depend on it.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Jet, you’re in the stabilization phase — your body is starting to quiet the chaos that caused those waves of shedding. Because chronic stress and menopause both nudge inflammation higher, boosting omega‑3s is your big domino right now. It steadies stress hormones and balances the shift in estrogen, helping your regrowing hairs stay anchored longer as you move toward sustained regrowth this year.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>Include a serving of fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) twice a week, or choose algae‑based capsules if you prefer plant options.</li>\n  <li>Drizzle a teaspoon of flaxseed or chia oil on oatmeal, yogurt, or roasted vegetables; avoid heating these oils.</li>\n  <li>Check any fish or algae oil caps for freshness — they should smell neutral, not “fishy.” Rancid oils can sabotage the benefit.</li>\n  <li>Balance fats: Cook mainly with olive or avocado oil, limit fried or overly processed foods that add extra omega‑6s.</li>\n  <li>Stay steady for three weeks; your body needs consistent intake to rebuild membranes around each follicle.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Softer scalp texture or less tightness feeling, a small drop in daily shed count, and smoother skin or nails within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Doom scrolling late at night can spike stress and cancel some of omega‑3’s calming effect — set a screen‑off timer 30 minutes before bed.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — every mindful bite of good fat is fuel for calmer follicles and steadier growth. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Steady the Ground Beneath Your Follicles 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Jet, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has eased since its peak in mid‑2024, but chronic stress and the hormonal shifts of menopause are still gently tugging at your balance. This week is about helping your body feel consistently “safe” again so those early baby hairs you’ve seen can stay anchored and keep growing stronger.</p>\n  <p>Because your main trigger is ongoing stress, and your sleep includes 2–3 nightly wakings, the practices ahead — your sleep anchor, wind‑down stack, and bedroom optimization — are the big dominoes that calm the entire system. Deep, steady sleep is when cortisol resets, growth hormones rise, and follicles repair. By training your brain and body to power down predictably, you signal your scalp that the danger has passed, inviting more follicles back into growth phase.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Stress buffering:</strong> steadier bedtime rhythms lower cortisol spikes that prolong shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone harmony:</strong> consistent sleep supports estrogen balance through menopause</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deep sleep restores nutrient delivery and oxygen flow to roots</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Resilience reset:</strong> better rest makes daily stressors less likely to trigger setbacks</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every calm evening routine you complete tells your body, “you’re safe now” — and that’s exactly what allows stronger, steadier regrowth to take root 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
