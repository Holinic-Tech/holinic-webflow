It’s about fueling your body (and hair) from the first hour, so your energy and mood stay steady all day long.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Becky, you’re in the stabilization phase — your shedding isn’t worsening, but stress is quietly holding back regrowth. A strong breakfast is the easiest lever to steady stress hormones and nourish follicles after the night’s fast. Because chronic stress has lingered since your illness, this simple upgrade is your “big domino” to help your body feel safe enough to shift into real regrowth mode.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Pick your base:</strong> Choose a fast 20–30 g protein option — like scrambled eggs with spinach, a protein smoothie, or tofu scramble with avocado.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add healthy fats & color:</strong> A drizzle of olive oil, handful of nuts, or flaxseed, plus colorful produce (berries, peppers, greens) to keep inflammation low.</li>\n  <li><strong>Set a morning rhythm:</strong> Eat within 60 minutes of waking to stabilize cortisol and blood sugar. Sip water before coffee.</li>\n  <li><strong>Keep backup options:</strong> Prep overnight oats with protein powder or keep boiled eggs/tahini wraps ready for busy mornings.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Notice steadier mid‑morning energy, fewer cravings by lunchtime, and calmer moods within a week.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating from stress may creep back after poor sleep. Quick fix: drink a tall glass of water and take 3 slow breaths before grabbing a snack — often that pause resets your body’s cue.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds calm from the inside out — one grounded breakfast at a time. 🌞</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” is about reshaping your meals so every bite fuels calm, steady regrowth. It’s not a diet—just gentle tweaks that keep your hormones balanced and your follicles well-fed.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Becky, since your shedding has stabilized but regrowth is slow, nutrition is your big domino. Chronic stress and perimenopause both drain key nutrients, and you’re right on the edge of your regrowth window. Filling your plate with steady protein, iron-rich foods, and omega‑3s helps your body switch from merely maintaining to rebuilding stronger strands.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor your day with protein.</strong> Start breakfast with 25–30 g of protein—think eggs with spinach or Greek yogurt with chia and almonds—to set your stress hormones on the right rhythm.</li>\n<li><strong>Build balanced plates.</strong> At lunch and dinner, aim for half a plate of colorful vegetables, a palm-sized portion of protein (salmon, chicken, lentils), and slow carbs like quinoa or sweet potato.</li>\n<li><strong>Add healthy fats daily.</strong> Include olive oil, nuts, or a small handful of seeds each day to support hormone stability and scalp hydration.</li>\n<li><strong>Color by nutrients.</strong> Choose at least three different colors of produce each day for zinc, antioxidants, and vitamin C, all crucial for follicle repair.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan, don’t restrict.</strong> Keep 1–2 easy-prep meals ready for stressful days so emotional eating doesn’t sneak in with nutrient‑poor foods.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier afternoon energy, fewer sugar cravings, and a more consistent mood within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast during busy mornings can trigger stress snacking later—prep overnight oats or a boiled egg box the night before.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds confidence—each balanced meal tells your body it’s safe to grow again. One plate at a time, your regrowth begins. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats centers on nourishing your scalp and follicles with omega‑3s from real food or a clean supplement. These healthy fats calm inflammation and support the hormonal balance that lets new strands grow stronger and shinier.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Becky, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has steadied, yet regrowth is still quiet because chronic stress is tugging at your hormones. Adding omega‑3s now is your “big domino.” It lowers stress‑linked inflammation and helps your scalp shift from holding onto survival mode toward gentle regrowth, especially as your body navigates perimenopause.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Start each week with a plan:</strong> Choose two days for oily fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) or record reminders if you use algae oil or fish‑oil capsules.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check freshness:</strong> Oils should smell clean, not fishy. Store capsules or bottles away from heat and light to prevent rancidity.</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance your plate:</strong> At each major meal, add one thumb‑size serving of healthy fat—like avocado, olive oil drizzle, or a sprinkle of chia or flax.</li>\n  <li><strong>Reduce the clutter:</strong> Limit deep‑fried or high‑omega‑6 seed oils (soy, corn, sunflower) that crowd out the benefits of your omega‑3s.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stay consistent for three weeks:</strong> Small daily inputs build your internal “oil reserves” that nourish new growth phases.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Softer scalp feeling within 7–10 days, fewer itch or tight‑scalp sensations, and slightly less dry skin or nails showing your fats are circulating well.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating under high stress may lead you toward processed comfort foods that block your progress. Quick fix: pair a mindful pause (deep breath, tall glass of water) before choosing your next bite.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Resetting Your Body’s Safety Signal 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Becky, you’re in the stabilization phase — the storm has passed, but your system still needs reassurance that it’s safe to move from shedding into growth. Because your chronic stress is ongoing and your body’s been running on high alert for a long time, this week is all about helping your nervous system and hormones exhale.</p>\n  <p>Your sleep and stress patterns are the “big domino” now. With 6–7 hours of rest and fairly regular bedtimes, you already have a base — but deep, consistent sleep is what truly lowers cortisol and tells your follicles the danger is over. When cortisol steadies, estrogen and thyroid signals rebalance, and the scalp’s microcirculation improves — all quiet cues your follicles need before they can regrow confidently.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer stress loop:</strong> lowers ongoing cortisol that keeps follicles in pause mode</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Deeper nightly repair:</strong> boosts growth hormone and collagen renewal during sleep</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone steadiness:</strong> supports perimenopausal balance and reduces inflammatory surges</li>\n    <li>🌿 <strong>Improved scalp circulation:</strong> delivers oxygen and nutrients needed for early regrowth</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each time you protect your wind‑down and sleep window this week, you teach your body that it’s safe to shift from holding on to shedding, toward calm, steady renewal 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
