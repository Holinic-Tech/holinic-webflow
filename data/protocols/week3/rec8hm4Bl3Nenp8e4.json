It’s a simple protein-first breakfast habit that steadies energy, mood, and shedding alike.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Carmen, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> of shedding—your body is under both hormonal shifts from perimenopause and chronic stress. After months of restrictive eating, your follicles are craving stability and amino acids. Making breakfast your anchor meal is the big domino: it calms cortisol swings and tells your body it’s safe to move toward stabilization before spring. Each balanced morning plate helps turn off the emergency mode driving excess hair fall.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Plan the night before:</strong> Choose a quick recipe with 20–30 g of protein—think 3 eggs with spinach, or a vegan smoothie with pea protein, oat milk, and blueberries.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within 60 minutes of waking:</strong> Pair your protein source with healthy fat (avocado, nut butter) and slow carbs (oats, sweet potato toast).</li>\n<li><strong>Add color and calm:</strong> Include one anti‑inflammatory extra—like turmeric, berries, or chia—for antioxidant support.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate early:</strong> A full glass of water or herbal tea before coffee keeps cortisol gentler on your system.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your energy:</strong> Notice if morning steadiness improves by day 4; that’s your signal your system’s stabilizing.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Fewer 11 a.m. crashes, calmer mood waves, and less intense shedding during morning brushing.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> If emotional eating shows up later in the day, it’s often skipped protein talking—add a small afternoon snack (Greek yogurt or hummus) to rebalance.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds safety in your body—and safety grows hair. One nourishing morning at a time, you’re turning this around. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron levels through food so your follicles can stay nourished and strong again. It’s about adding easy, iron‑rich meals and removing small habits that quietly block absorption.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Right now, you’re in the <em>peak</em> phase of shedding—your body is still catching up after months of hormonal shifts, stress, and restricted eating. Low iron adds fuel to that fire. By turning up your iron intake now, you give each new strand the oxygen and strength it needs to move you toward stabilization and the first signs of regrowth by early summer 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one iron hero meal a day.</strong> Aim for a palm‑size portion of lean red meat, mushrooms, lentils, or spinach cooked in a cast‑iron pan if possible.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with vitamin C.</strong> Add citrus, bell peppers, or strawberries to the same meal to double absorption naturally.</li>\n<li><strong>Skip blockers at mealtime.</strong> Keep coffee, tea, and calcium‑rich foods at least an hour away from your main iron meal.</li>\n<li><strong>Listen to your body’s energy.</strong> Note whether focus and stamina lift after a week; these are signs your system is using the extra iron well.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it consistent.</strong> One iron‑nourishing meal every day for the next three weeks builds the reserves your hair depends on.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less afternoon fatigue, brighter skin tone, and the hair in your brush starting to thin less within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating during stressful evenings may lead to skipping protein—prep an easy iron option in advance as your safety net.</li>\n<li>Every bite you fortify is a quiet “yes” to recovery. Stay steady—each nutrient‑dense meal helps move you toward calmer shedding and stronger roots. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you bring omega‑3s back onto your plate — the specific fats that calm inflammation, steady hormones, and support healthy hair roots from within.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Carmen, you’re right in the <em>peak</em> phase, when shedding feels unrelenting. Because stress, perimenopause, and restrictive eating are active triggers, your scalp is missing steady anti‑inflammatory support. This step is your “big domino.” Restoring omega‑3 fats now helps buffer the hormonal shifts and calms the stress chemistry driving breakage — setting you up for stabilization by spring and early regrowth by mid‑2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one daily omega‑3 source:</strong> Choose 3 oz of salmon, sardines, trout, or anchovies; or 1 tablespoon of ground flaxseed or chia for plant-based support.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan it early:</strong> Have your omega‑3 food at breakfast or lunch so your body uses it for the day’s hormone balance and cell repair.</li>\n<li><strong>If supplementing:</strong> Pick a fresh fish or algae oil with combined EPA + DHA (at least 1000 mg). Keep it refrigerated and smell test for any “fishy” odor — that means rancid, toss it.</li>\n<li><strong>Cut the competing oils:</strong> Ease back on processed foods high in soybean, corn, or sunflower oils, which crowd out omega‑3s.</li>\n<li><strong>Track consistency:</strong> Aim for five omega‑3 servings per week and note how your skin and scalp feel by week two.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less tender scalp and fewer “peek‑through” areas when you part your hair; calmer moods or fewer hot flashes within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Emotional eating under stress can still lead you toward low‑fat “comfort” foods — prep one omega‑3 option ahead as an easy grab instead.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing meal at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Calming the Peak: Creating Safety for Your Follicles 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Carmen, you’re in the <em>peak phase</em> of shedding — the moment when your body is still reacting to ongoing stress, perimenopausal shifts, and nutrition strain from restrictive dieting. This week’s focus on stabilization is about telling your system it’s safe to pause the alarm response that keeps follicles in “release mode.”</p>\n  <p>Even though you sleep 7–8 hours, those 2–3 night wakings keep cortisol slightly elevated overnight, which can block recovery.
