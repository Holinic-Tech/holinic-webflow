Because you currently eat just one high‑protein meal a day, your mornings are missing the raw materials your follicles need. This single shift is your “big domino”: fueling breakfast with 30 g of protein steadies your stress curve and signals your body it’s safe to grow again.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Decide tonight:</strong> Choose tomorrow’s protein base — 3 eggs, Greek yogurt with hemp seeds, or a vegan shake with pea protein powder.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add color + fiber:</strong> Toss in spinach, berries, or a handful of oats for steady energy and nutrient variety.</li>\n  <li><strong>Include healthy fat:</strong> A teaspoon of olive oil, nut butter, or chia seeds keeps you full and calms hormones.</li>\n  <li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> This anchors your body clock, especially since your sleep runs short and irregular.</li>\n  <li><strong>Repeat daily for 21 days:</strong> Plan quick options for busy mornings so you never skip this step.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Morning focus feels clearer, energy dips lessen after lunch, and you notice fewer mid‑day sugar cravings within two weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast on rushed days can undo progress. Quick fix — keep hard‑boiled eggs or a ready shake in the fridge.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum, one nourishing morning at a time. 🌅</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Tweak What’s on Your Plate” helps you shape each meal so your body gets the steady nutrients it needs to rebuild strong follicles and keep shedding calm. It’s less about restriction and more about small, daily upgrades that feed your hair from the inside out.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ioanna, you’re in the stabilization phase — your shedding is still active, but the next growth wave depends on fueling new follicles. With menopause winding down and stress still ongoing, your plate is the strongest lever you control each day. A balanced, protein‑rich, omega‑supporting meal rhythm can shorten the gap to that first regrowth window around July 2025. This is your “big domino” right now — nourishment equals momentum.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start with protein in every meal.</strong> Aim for roughly a palm‑sized portion (20–30 g) at breakfast, lunch, and dinner — eggs, Greek yogurt, chicken, lentils, or tofu.</li>\n<li><strong>Add a color trio.</strong> Choose three colorful plant foods daily — spinach, peppers, berries — for antioxidants that cushion follicles from stress.</li>\n<li><strong>Bring back healthy fats.</strong> Include one source of omega‑3s daily: a handful of walnuts, chia seeds, or a small salmon portion a few times a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate and pause.</strong> Drink a large glass of water before meals and take 3 slow breaths before your first bite to help digestion and absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Batch your wins.</strong> Prep one go‑to “hair plate” — for example, Greek yogurt with flaxseed and berries — so healthy choices feel automatic on busy days.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> You’ll notice steadier energy, less afternoon slump, and fewer “hungry evenings” within 7–10 days — all signs your hormones are stabilizing.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or relying on coffee till noon can spike stress hormones; anchor your day with a protein‑rich first meal to steady them.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — each balanced plate becomes a quiet message to your follicles that safety and growth have returned. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you raise your intake of omega‑3s — the anti‑inflammatory fats that calm scalp inflammation, smooth hormone shifts, and feed the tiny oil glands that protect each strand.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Ioanna, during stabilization your follicles are catching their breath after months of stress and hormonal waves. Low omega‑3s, combined with perimenopausal changes, can lengthen that lag. Adding the right fats now can quiet your scalp’s stress signals and set up steady regrowth by next summer — this is your “big domino” for moving from fragile to flourishing cycles.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Upgrade two meals a week:</strong> Choose salmon, sardines, or mackerel, cooked gently (not deep‑fried) to protect fats.</li>\n<li><strong>Plant option:</strong> If fish isn’t reliable, take an algae‑based omega‑3 supplement with both EPA and DHA; check expiry — rancid oil smells fishy or sharp.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance your oils:</strong> Use olive or avocado oil for cooking and cut back on seed oils (sunflower, corn, soy) that crowd out omega‑3s.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair with protein:</strong> Combine with lean protein (chicken, eggs, tofu) to give follicles both the building blocks and the “anti‑inflammatory calm.”</li>\n<li><strong>Store well:</strong> Keep capsules or bottles in the fridge away from light and heat to prevent oxidation.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Within two weeks, itchiness or scalp tightness eases; skin feels less dry; energy after meals steadies.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast or long fasting can blunt absorption — add a few walnuts or chia seeds with your first meal to keep levels steady.</li>\n<li>Consistency compounds quietly — every dose is a message to your follicles: “safe to grow again.” 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Steady the Ground Beneath Your Hair 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Ioanna, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is easing but your scalp cycles haven’t yet reset. Because your chronic stress and perimenopausal changes are still ongoing, this week’s focus is to calm the internal “storm” so your follicles feel safe again. Think of it as creating still water before new growth can reflect.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your body needs rhythm more than intensity. With only 5–6 hours of interrupted sleep and a shifting schedule, your cortisol stays elevated while growth hormones stay low. The practices this week — setting a consistent sleep anchor, winding down before bed, and optimizing your bedroom — directly lower stress chemistry at night, helping your follicles move out of the shedding signal faster.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> steady bedtime cues teach your body when to power down and repair</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormone balance:</strong> deeper sleep helps smooth perimenopausal fluctuations that delay regrowth</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Reactivates follicle recovery:</strong> calmer nights restore oxygen flow and nutrient delivery to roots</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Builds stress resilience:</strong> nightly rituals train your system to stay balanced even when life feels busy</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your wind‑down and protect your sleep, you’re sending your body the message it’s been waiting for: “It’s safe to grow again.” 🌱</em></p>\n</div>"}}
