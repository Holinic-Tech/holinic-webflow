After months of riding wave‑like shedding, the right first meal is your “big domino.” A protein‑centered breakfast calms cortisol spikes from short, irregular sleep and stops the mid‑morning crashes that drain recovery. This single rhythm helps you head toward calmer shedding and the regrowth window by May. 🌅</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Within an hour of waking,</strong> sit down for a real meal — not just coffee or fruit. Aim for about 25–30 g of protein.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick omnivore option:</strong> 2 eggs + a slice of whole‑grain toast with avocado and hemp seeds, or Greek yogurt topped with berries and chia.</li>\n<li><strong>Quick vegan option:</strong> tofu or lentil scramble with spinach, or a smoothie with pea protein, banana, and oat milk.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color:</strong> include one handful of fruit or greens — antioxidants keep inflammation lower.</li>\n<li><strong>Plan ahead:</strong> prep portions at night so your morning feels effortless, even after a short sleep.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> more stable morning energy, fewer cravings by noon, and a softer dip in midday shedding during combing or wash days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> skipping breakfast after a stress‑filled night can spike emotional eating later. Fix it with a grab‑and‑go smoothie so protein still lands early.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced morning at a time, your body learns safety again and hair follows. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<h3>What it is</h3> \n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you rebuild your iron stores through food and timing, so your follicles finally get the oxygen and nutrients they’ve been missing. It’s about steady nourishment, not supplements or restriction—just smarter meals that quietly feed new growth from the inside out.</p> \n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3> \n<p>Marilou, you mentioned past low iron and only one high‑protein meal a day. During this stabilization phase, your body is still recovering from the hormonal shifts and chronic stress that began last summer. Re‑stocking iron is your “big domino”—it steadies energy and helps maturing hairs anchor firmly until regrowth takes off around May. Think of every iron‑rich meal now as setting tomorrow’s growth in motion.</p> \n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3> \n<ol> \n<li><strong>Add iron at breakfast or lunch.</strong> Include one iron-dense food daily—like lentils, spinach, beef, or fortified oats—to keep absorption steady.</li> \n<li><strong>Pair with vitamin C.</strong> Add citrus, berries, or bell pepper to that meal to multiply iron uptake.</li> \n<li><strong>Space your tea/coffee.</strong> Have them at least one hour after eating; they block absorption even if caffeine-free.</li> \n<li><strong>Boost protein to 2 meals/day.</strong> Combine iron sources with eggs, chicken, or tofu to give follicles the amino acids they crave.</li> \n<li><strong>Track your energy.</strong> Note mid‑afternoon stamina or clearer focus—it’s often the first sign your stores are rebuilding.</li> \n</ol> \n\n<h3>What to look for</h3> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Less afternoon dragging, warmer hands/feet, and a subtle drop in shedding by week 2 – 3.</li> \n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals when stress hits—this starves iron replenishment. Quick fix: prep one go‑to iron snack like hummus with peppers on stressful days.</li> \n<li>Consistency builds quiet strength, one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li> \n</ul> \n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p><em>Time Your Food</em> helps your digestion and hormones reset overnight by giving your body a few quiet hours between your last meal and sleep. When you stop eating earlier, your body can shift from “processing mode” to “repair mode,” which supports better rest and calmer shedding cycles.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Marilou, right now you’re in the stabilization phase — the point where your body starts to calm shedding after months of hormonal and stress changes. Because you currently eat about an hour before bed and your sleep runs short and irregular, this practice is your big domino. Creating a two‑hour buffer before sleep steadies nighttime blood sugar and reduces stress hormones, helping your body step closer to its regrowth window this spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li>For the next 7 nights, finish your last bite at least two hours before your planned bedtime.</li>\n  <li>If hunger hits late, choose a calming ritual instead — a warm caffeine‑free tea or journaling — to remind your brain that rest, not food, is next.</li>\n  <li>Set a recurring evening reminder on your phone for “kitchen closed” time to make the habit automatic.</li>\n  <li>As your body adjusts, aim for a steady dinner time even on weekends to reinforce your sleep rhythm.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Falling asleep faster within a week, less bloating or heaviness at bedtime, and waking a bit more refreshed.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Emotional snacking after stressful evenings — when that urge shows up, step outside for two deep breaths or wrap your hands around a warm mug of tea instead.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — one well‑timed dinner and restful night at a time. 🌙</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Time Your Food","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Time to Calm the Storm and Rebuild Your Foundation 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Marilou, you’re in the stabilization phase — that gentle turning point after the hardest waves of shedding. Because your post‑pill hormone change from July 2025 and ongoing stress are still active, this week is all about teaching your body that it’s safe to slow the fallout. The tools we’ll use — steady sleep anchors, a peaceful wind‑down, and a calm bedroom — are the “big domino” that helps every other system reset.</p>\n  <p>When sleep and routine fall into rhythm, cortisol levels drop and your hormones begin to re‑synchronize. Deep sleep also boosts growth‑related signals that tell follicles to hold onto strands longer. With your current 5–6 hours of rest and shifting bedtimes, these practices will help your body move out of survival mode and into repair mode — the exact shift needed before regrowth can start this spring.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol balance:</strong> lowers daily stress load so follicles stay out of shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal steadiness:</strong> supports your body’s adjustment after the July 2025 change</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deeper sleep cycles:</strong> restore nightly repair and nutrient delivery to roots</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Energy recovery:</strong> reduces fatigue and emotional eating triggers that drain reserves</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you honor your bedtime and create calm, you’re telling your body, “we’re steady now” — and that’s when shedding finally begins to ease. 🌱</em></p>\n</div>"}}
