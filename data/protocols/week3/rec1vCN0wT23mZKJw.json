A balanced, quick meal anchors your energy and lowers inflammation before the day takes over.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is still high, but the worst wave has already crested. Right now, your body is asking for steady building blocks. Since you’ve been averaging only one high-protein meal and navigating stress plus hormone shifts, this breakfast anchor is your big domino: it smooths stress hormones early and gives your follicles the raw material to shift toward regrowth in the coming months.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose a protein base: 2 scrambled eggs + veggies, or a vegan smoothie with pea protein.</li>\n    <li>Add healthy fats for satiety: avocado slices, chia seeds, or a spoon of nut butter.</li>\n    <li>Round out with fiber: berries, spinach, or whole oats.</li>\n    <li>Prep evening before if mornings are rushed — overnight oats or portioned smoothie bags work beautifully.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More even energy through the morning without crashing mid-day; fewer intense sugar cravings; steadier mood within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast when stress feels heavy — quick fix: keep a 30g protein shake ready-to-go so you never miss the anchor.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one strong breakfast can truly reset your day and give your follicles the calm, steady fuel they need. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>The Popeye Protocol is a simple set of food shifts designed to increase your iron intake and make sure your body can actually absorb it. When your cells have enough iron, your hair gets the fuel it needs to restart growth.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Pietra, you’ve shared that you’ve had low iron before, and right now you’re in the stabilization phase — the shedding has been rough, but the sharpest drop has already passed. Iron is your “big domino”: without it, follicles stay stuck; with it, they can reawaken. Strengthening your iron intake now positions your body for regrowth in early 2026, even with ongoing stress in the background.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Choose one iron‑rich food daily: spinach, lentils, red meat, pumpkin seeds, or chickpeas.</li>\n    <li>Pair that food with a vitamin C source (like bell peppers, citrus, or strawberries) at the same meal to boost absorption.</li>\n    <li>Avoid tea, coffee, or high‑calcium dairy within 1–2 hours of your iron‑rich meal — they block absorption.</li>\n    <li>Track how often you hit this combo in a notebook or phone note; celebrate 4+ iron‑focused meals by week’s end.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier energy through your afternoons, fewer dizzy/lightheaded spells, and more consistent warmth in hands and feet within 1–2 weeks.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping protein at breakfast (you mentioned most days are low in protein) — quick fix: add an egg, Greek yogurt, or a scoop of beans at your first meal.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — each iron‑rich plate is a quiet nudge toward your follicles waking up again. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n  <h3>What it is</h3> \n  <p>“Eat More Good Fats” is about giving your body steady omega‑3s — the kind of fats that calm inflammation and support healthy follicles from the inside out.</p> \n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3> \n  <p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase, where your shedding has started to level but your scalp is still waiting for a calmer internal signal before regrowth takes off. With your history of chronic stress and low intake of omega‑3s, this is the lever that can soften inflammation and prepare your follicles to shift from survival back to growth. Think of it as laying fertile ground before the sprouts return.</p> \n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3> \n  <ol> \n    <li>Add one reliable source of omega‑3s daily: fatty fish (like salmon, sardines, mackerel), or an algae‑based supplement if you avoid fish.</li> \n    <li>Pair your omega‑3s with protein at a meal (for example: salmon with eggs or tofu) to improve absorption and satiety.</li> \n    <li>If supplementing, choose a product that lists both EPA and DHA amounts and check it smells fresh (no “fishy burp” should linger).</li> \n    <li>Aim for consistency: small daily doses work far better than an occasional large one.</li> \n  </ol> \n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3> \n  <ul> \n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Within 2 weeks, you may notice less scalp dryness or flaking; your energy and focus after meals can feel steadier; some women also see skin glow improve first, which is a sign your body is using these fats well.</li> \n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Given your late‑day caffeine habit, pairing omega‑3 with a late meal might keep your digestion active near bedtime. Quick fix: take it with lunch or an earlier dinner instead.</li> \n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — each daily dose is like watering the soil that will soon let your baby hairs break through. 🌱</li> \n  </ul> \n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Creating Calm Conditions for Your Follicles 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase now — the worst of the shedding spike has passed, but because your main driver is ongoing chronic stress, your body still feels “on alert.” This week is about helping your system feel safe again so it can shift gears from constant shedding toward recovery.</p>\n  <p>The cornerstone here is restoring rhythm. With your late caffeine, 2–3 night wakings, shift-style sleep, and untreated insomnia, your body isn’t getting the deep, restorative rest it needs. That lack of steady sleep keeps cortisol high and blocks the nightly hormone and repair signals your follicles rely on. By anchoring a bedtime, winding down with intention, and fencing off late caffeine, you give your nervous system the clearest signal that it’s time to lower stress chemistry and allow repair to begin.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress load:</strong> calming the chronic cortisol surge that keeps follicles in “shed mode”</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormonal reset:</strong> steady sleep-wake cycles help balance disrupted rhythms from stress and past hormonal shifts</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Repair window:</strong> deeper sleep releases growth hormone that fuels follicle recovery</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Resilience:</strong> strengthens your body’s buffer against ongoing emotional and chronic stress</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each time you protect your evening routine, you’re not just helping tonight’s sleep — you’re teaching your body it’s safe to heal, one night closer to calmer shedding and the first wave of baby hairs 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
