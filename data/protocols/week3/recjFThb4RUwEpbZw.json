{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” is about starting your morning with a protein-packed meal so your body and hair get steady fuel right from the first hour of your day.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Elena, because you’re in the peak shedding phase and your stress has been running high, your body wakes up already running on empty. Pair that with only one protein-rich meal later in the day, and your hair isn’t getting the daily building blocks it craves. A strong breakfast becomes your big domino: it steadies mood, calms stress spikes, and sets the stage for moving from this turbulent peak toward more stable hair health.</p>\n  \n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Plan a simple 20–30g protein option the night before (overnight oats with protein powder, or eggs with avocado toast).</li>\n    <li>When you wake up, drink a glass of water, then sit down to eat within 60 minutes.</li>\n    <li>On busy mornings, blend a smoothie: frozen berries, plant or whey protein, nut butter, and oat milk.</li>\n    <li>Rotate between 2–3 favorites (vegan tofu scramble, Greek yogurt bowl, salmon and rice) so it feels easy and not repetitive.</li>\n  </ol>\n  \n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More steady energy mid-morning, less frantic hunger later in the day, and a calmer mood even in stressful moments.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast and falling into late-morning doom scrolling — quick fix: prep something the night before so no decisions are required when you’re tired.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced breakfast at a time. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>Tweak What’s on Your Plate is about gently upgrading your meals so your body has the raw building blocks to grow strong, resilient hair from the inside out.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Elena, you’re in the peak phase, which means shedding feels heavy and constant. With stress running high and only one protein-rich meal a day, your follicles may not be getting the steady fuel they need. Strengthening nutrition now is your “big domino”—it supports calmer shedding while setting the stage for stabilization and regrowth in the months ahead.</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Start your day with a protein anchor: aim for at least 20–30 g at breakfast (think eggs + Greek yogurt, or a protein smoothie with nut butter).</li>\n    <li>Add one extra protein-rich element to lunch or dinner—chicken, lentils, tofu, or salmon when you can.</li>\n    <li>Include a colorful vegetable or leafy green at each meal to boost minerals and antioxidants that hair thrives on.</li>\n    <li>Swap one snack this week for a hair-nourishing option—like hummus with carrots, or a boiled egg with fruit.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable daily energy, steadier moods, and feeling less “crashy” between meals within 7–10 days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals when stress is high (doom scrolling often delays eating). Quick fix: set a reminder and keep a ready-to-go snack within reach.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing plate at a time, your body begins to shift from crisis mode to growth mode. 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n  <h3>What it is</h3>\n  <p>“Eat More Good Fats” is about adding omega‑3 rich foods or supplements into your week, so your scalp environment becomes calmer and your strands get the raw materials they need to grow strong.</p>\n\n  <h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n  <p>Elena, you’re still in peak shedding, and I know that feels heavy. With high daily stress and an ongoing illness flare, your body is fighting inflammation 24/7. Omega‑3s act like a soothing balm inside: they calm stress‑linked inflammation and help your hair move toward stabilization sooner, setting the stage for new growth once regrowth starts in 2026. This one shift is your “big domino.”</p>\n\n  <h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n  <ol>\n    <li>Add 2 meals this week with fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel). If you don’t enjoy fish, aim for a quality algae oil supplement.</li>\n    <li>Pair omega‑3 foods with colorful veggies (vitamin C helps absorption and supports collagen).</li>\n    <li>Check freshness: avoid fish oils that smell fishy or rancid—those can do more harm than good.</li>\n    <li>Repeat weekly: aim for 2–3 servings of omega‑3 rich foods or supplements on rotation.</li>\n  </ol>\n\n  <h3>What to look for</h3>\n  <ul>\n    <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> less itchy or irritated scalp within 1–2 weeks; smoother skin on hands/lips; steadier moods on stressful days.</li>\n    <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> doom scrolling late at night can undo the calming effect of omega‑3s by keeping stress hormones high — swap 10 minutes of scrolling for prepping tomorrow’s meal instead.</li>\n    <li>Consistency builds momentum — each nourishing bite is you signaling your body: “It’s safe to heal.” 🌱</li>\n  </ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats"}}
