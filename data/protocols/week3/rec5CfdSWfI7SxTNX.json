Because your chronic illness trigger is still active, the fastest way to help your scalp calm down is by reducing the daily “micro-stresses” that keep follicles on edge. That’s why this week’s focus on sleep anchors, winding down, and caffeine timing matters so much for you.</p>\n  <p>When you get only 6–7 hours of broken sleep, with 2–3 wake-ups and late caffeine, your body stays in a light stress state. That means cortisol stays higher, growth hormone release is blunted, and your follicles don’t get the full repair signal at night. By tightening your sleep window, cutting off caffeine after lunch, and creating a wind‑down ritual, you’re directly telling your system: “it’s safe to pause the shedding cycle.”</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Cortisol reset:</strong> steadier sleep lowers the stress hormone that prolongs shedding</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm:</strong> consistent bedtimes help your cycle regulate despite irregular periods</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery:</strong> deep sleep releases growth signals that fuel new hair cells</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Energy stability:</strong> less caffeine late in the day improves rest and daily resilience</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you’re not just resting — you’re teaching your body to shift out of loss mode and prepare for visible regrowth in the months ahead 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
