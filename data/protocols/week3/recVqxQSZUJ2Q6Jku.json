{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” is about starting each morning with a protein‑anchored, low‑inflammatory meal — one that steadies your energy, mood, and hormones from the moment you wake up.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, you’re in your stabilization phase — shedding has eased, and your baby hairs show that regrowth is underway. Because your hormones are still settling after stopping birth control, a balanced breakfast is your “big domino”: it blunts the stress surges that can still rattle your scalp. The right morning meal helps your follicles stay calm and nurtured as you move toward steady regrowth. 🌞</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Within 60 minutes of waking,</strong> eat 25–30 g of protein (about a palm‑sized portion). This stabilizes blood sugar and keeps cortisol in check.</li>\n<li><strong>Build a simple formula:</strong> protein + healthy fat + gentle fiber. For example, eggs with avocado and greens, or a tofu scramble with olive oil and veggies.</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it anti‑inflammatory:</strong> choose olive oil or chia over refined oils, berries over sugary fruit, and sprouted grains or oats if you eat carbs.</li>\n<li><strong>Vegan swap:</strong> try a smoothie with pea or hemp protein, spinach, berries, and nut butter. Add cinnamon for flavor and stable energy.</li>\n<li><strong>Batch it:</strong> prep breakfast jars or egg muffins on Sunday so “I’m too tired” never wins your morning.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier morning energy, fewer mid‑day crashes, and less scalp tingling or shedding around wash days within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping breakfast after late‑night scrolling delays your first meal and spikes stress hormones — set your phone aside overnight or leave it charging outside the kitchen.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds stability — one grounded breakfast at a time. You’re already closer to the regrowth phase than you think. 🌿</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you rebuild your iron stores gently through food, so your follicles have steady oxygen and energy to grow stronger strands.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding has calmed and new hairs are pushing through. Because lab tests once showed low iron and you eat only one high-protein meal a day, this is your big domino. Strengthening iron intake right now helps lock in that progress and keeps follicles from slipping back into “rest mode” as your hormones rebalance after December’s shift.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add an iron champion every day:</strong> include lentils, beef, chicken thighs, spinach cooked with olive oil, or fortified oats—whichever feels easiest to repeat.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair iron foods with vitamin C:</strong> squeeze lemon over greens or add fruit after meals to multiply absorption.</li>\n<li><strong>Mind the blockers:</strong> keep coffee or tea at least one hour away from your iron‑rich meals.</li>\n<li><strong>Boost protein alongside iron:</strong> aim for 20–30 g each meal (e.g., eggs at breakfast, beans or fish at lunch) so hair‑building amino acids stay consistent.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your energy:</strong> note any improvement in focus or warmth—these often rise as iron restores.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> steadier morning energy, less dizziness when standing, and brighter facial colour within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping meals or late caffeine can blunt absorption—if you catch yourself doom‑scrolling through dinner, pause, set your phone aside, and eat mindfully first.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—every balanced plate is another vote for regrowth. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” restores the healthy oils your scalp and hormones rely on. It helps calm inflammation and gives your follicles the steady nutrition they need for strong, shiny regrowth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Pietra, you’re in your stabilization phase — shedding’s easing and baby hairs are sprouting. After stopping birth control last year, your body’s rebuilding hormonal balance. Because you rarely eat fatty fish, adding omega‑3s right now can be the single biggest boost to help your follicles hold onto new growth and keep your scalp calm as you move toward full regrowth mid‑2025.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one source of omega‑3 daily.</strong> Choose from salmon, sardines, mackerel, trout, or a plant version like chia seeds, flax, or algae oil (great if you don’t eat fish).</li>\n<li><strong>Supplement smartly.</strong> If taking fish or algae oil, check the label for at least 1000 mg combined EPA + DHA per day and store it in the fridge to avoid rancidity.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance your plate.</strong> Pair your protein meal with avocado, olives, or nuts to keep overall fat quality high while avoiding processed seed oils.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay consistent.</strong> Keep this habit daily for three weeks, even when life is busy—steady intake makes the difference you’ll see later in your hair texture and shine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> calmer scalp or less itching within 10 days, increased natural shine, and steadier energy through the day.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> skipping meals or eating too late (you often dine right before bed) may dull absorption — aim to finish dinner 2 hours earlier.</li>\n<li>Consistency compounds — each balanced meal is a quiet yes to your regrowth. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steadying Your System So Regrowth Can Take Over 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Pietra, your body is in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — shedding is calming after its late‑2024 peak, and those baby hairs you’ve noticed mean your follicles are already re‑awakening. Because your main trigger was a <strong>post‑pill hormonal shift</strong> layered with ongoing stress and sleep disruption, this week is about giving your system the steady rhythm it needs to stay out of “alarm mode.”</p>\n  <p>The <em>Stabilize</em> practices — anchoring a consistent sleep window, winding down before bed, and setting a caffeine cut‑off — directly calm cortisol and help your hormones re‑synchronize. When sleep is predictable, your body releases growth and repair signals on time, restores thyroid and adrenal balance, and keeps scalp circulation strong enough to nourish new roots. With your shift‑work schedule and late caffeine habits, these are the levers that unlock faster recovery.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Quiets stress hormones:</strong> lowers the background cortisol that keeps follicles in shed mode</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Resets hormonal rhythm:</strong> supports balance after the post‑pill transition</li>\n    <li>🌙 <strong>Deepens sleep cycles:</strong> triggers growth hormone release for follicle repair</li>\n    <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Improves scalp circulation:</strong> better nutrient delivery to emerging baby hairs</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you stick to your sleep anchor and caffeine boundary, you’re teaching your body that it’s safe to grow again — one calm evening at a time 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
