{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p><em>Win Your Day with Breakfast</em> is about starting your morning with a balanced, protein-rich meal that lowers stress hormones and fuels steady energy. By giving your body nutrients early, you anchor your metabolism so your hair and mood feel more stable all day.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katie, you’re entering the stabilization phase—shedding is easing, but regrowth can only thrive when blood sugar and hormones calm down. With perimenopause and ongoing stress still nudging your sleep and cortisol, this practice is your “big domino.” A steady, protein‑centered breakfast gives your follicles the amino acids and hormonal balance they need to shift toward regrowth as your body steadies into early 2026.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Commit to breakfast within one hour of waking.</strong> Keep it simple: eggs with spinach and avocado, or Greek yogurt with berries and chia seeds.</li>\n  <li><strong>Hit 25–30 g of protein.</strong> Mix and match—two eggs + ½ cup Greek yogurt, or a smoothie with pea protein, almond butter, banana, and oats.</li>\n  <li><strong>Include color and healthy fats.</strong> Add one fruit or veg and a drizzle of olive or flaxseed oil for anti‑inflammatory support.</li>\n  <li><strong>Rotate ideas.</strong> Try one vegan (tofu scramble, protein oatmeal) and one omnivore option so you don’t get bored.</li>\n  <li><strong>Plan ahead.</strong> Batch‑prep smoothie packs or overnight oats on Sunday—make it easy for your 6 a.m. self.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Smoother mid‑morning energy, fewer sugar crashes, and less shedding during stressful mornings within 7–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast after a night of <6 hours’ sleep can send stress hormones soaring—set a reminder and eat even a small meal.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing morning at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you gently raise your iron stores through smart food combinations, so your follicles can receive the oxygen and nutrients they need to spark thicker regrowth.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katie, you’re in the stabilization phase—shedding has settled, but new baby hairs haven’t popped yet. Because you’ve been told you have low iron and you’re navigating perimenopause, your body needs a steady supply of absorbable iron to flip the switch into regrowth early this year. This is your “big domino” now: build iron, and energy rises, shedding quiets, and those dormant follicles finally reboot. 🌿</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Anchor iron-rich meals twice daily:</strong> Focus on lean red meat, lentils, tofu, or spinach sautéed with olive oil. Your body absorbs small, steady amounts best.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair iron with vitamin C:</strong> Add a squeeze of lemon, citrus, or bell pepper to your meals—this boosts absorption up to threefold.</li>\n<li><strong>Avoid blockers near iron meals:</strong> Skip coffee, tea, or high-calcium foods (like milk) within 1 hour before or after an iron-rich dish.</li>\n<li><strong>Track your energy:</strong> Use how you feel—less fatigue, steadier warmth in hands/feet—as early markers your stores are improving.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Within 2 weeks you’ll likely feel fewer midday crashes, warmer fingertips, and a touch more color in your face—signs your blood oxygen is improving.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping balanced dinners or sleeping only 5–6 hours blunts iron uptake. Fix: add a protein‑rich evening meal and commit to a consistent bedtime window this week.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each iron‑focused meal is another drop filling your hair’s energy tank. Keep going, and regrowth will follow soon. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps your body calm inflammation and rebuild healthy scalp tissue by enriching your meals with omega‑3s—nutrients that steady hormones and support the follicles that are ready to re‑activate.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Katie, you’re in your <strong>stabilization phase</strong>—shedding is easing, and your body’s gearing up for regrowth after months of stress and perimenopausal shifts. Omega‑3 fats are your “big domino” nutrient right now; they soothe stress‑linked inflammation and support the hormonal balance that lets fresh hairs anchor deeply. This step helps you move smoothly toward visible baby hairs in your upcoming regrowth stage.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Pick your source:</strong> Have a serving of fatty fish (salmon, sardines, mackerel) twice per week, or choose algae or fish‑oil capsules that list both EPA and DHA together (around 500–1000 mg combined daily).</li>\n<li><strong>Keep it fresh:</strong> Store fish and oils in the fridge, and check there’s no “fishy” odor—rancid oil can do more harm than good.</li>\n<li><strong>Add daily sillies of flavor:</strong> Toss ground flax, chia, or walnuts onto breakfast oats or mix a spoon of olive oil into warm veggies.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance the fats:</strong> Ease back on deep‑fried or seed‑oil foods (sunflower, soybean), which compete with omega‑3s for the same pathways.</li>\n<li><strong>Stay steady:</strong> Aim for consistency, not perfection—just two mindful choices a day create a measurable shift in scalp nutrition within weeks.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> scalp feels less tight or itchy, energy steadies in mid‑afternoon, and skin looks a bit more dewy within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping meals during late nights can blunt absorption—keep a small protein + fat snack handy if you’re up past dinner.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Steadying Your Foundation So Regrowth Can Begin 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Katie, you’re in the <strong>stabilization phase</strong> — the hardest stretch is behind you, and your body is trying to find its rhythm again. Because your main triggers — <strong>perimenopause and ongoing stress</strong> — are still active, this week’s focus on restoring deep, predictable rest is what helps your system finally exhale. Think of it as giving your follicles the “all clear” signal that it’s safe to stop shedding.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your late nights, 2–3 night wakings, and 5–6 hours of sleep keep cortisol slightly elevated, which can still nudge hairs into the shed phase. The practices in this week — setting a consistent sleep anchor, winding down with calm rituals, and optimizing your sleep space — help reset cortisol patterns, boost nighttime growth hormone, and balance the hormonal shifts of perimenopause that make hair more sensitive to stress.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Calmer stress response:</strong> steadier cortisol signals mean fewer sudden shed cycles</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm support:</strong> consistent sleep helps balance estrogen and melatonin patterns</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Follicle recovery time:</strong> deep sleep restores cellular energy for new growth</li>\n    <li>💤 <strong>Better rest quality:</strong> strengthens resilience against ongoing emotional and chronic stress</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you anchor your sleep, you’re teaching your body safety again — and that’s the moment shedding turns into subtle regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
