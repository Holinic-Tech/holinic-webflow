{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” is about starting your morning with a steady, protein‑rich meal—so your stress hormones settle and your energy stays consistent from the first hour of the day.</p>\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Aidee, you’re in the stabilization phase—your shedding is easing but still comes in waves because chronic stress is ongoing. After years of high pressure and short sleep, breakfast is your big domino: it steadies blood sugar and signals calm to your body before the day’s challenges start. Mastering this now helps your regrowth strengthen by spring.</p>\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Set your anchor time:</strong> Eat within 60 minutes of waking, even on busy mornings or shift days.</li>\n<li><strong>Build the 30‑gram plate:</strong> Combine protein (2 eggs or ¾ cup tofu) + fiber (½ cup oats or veggies) + healthy fat (½ avocado or nuts).</li>\n<li><strong>Omnivore option:</strong> Greek yogurt with berries and chia, or eggs with spinach and olive oil‑toast.</li>\n<li><strong>Vegan option:</strong> Smoothie with pea protein, soy milk, pumpkin seeds, and frozen fruit—blend and sip on the go.</li>\n<li><strong>Pair it with calm:</strong> While you eat, avoid screens; breathe deeply and let your body feel “safe” before diving into work.</li>\n</ol>\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Morning jitters ease, fewer mid‑day crashes, and noticeably steadier mood within a week or two.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping breakfast during hectic mornings will spike stress later. Quick fix: prep a shake or overnight oats the night before.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum—each grounded morning helps your body trust it’s time for recovery and strong new growth. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>The Popeye Protocol helps you quietly rebuild your iron stores through smart, steady food choices—so your follicles get the oxygen and nutrients they’ve been missing for far too long.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Aidee, you’ve been in shedding waves for more than a year, and with your history of low iron plus long-term stress, your scalp’s recovery depends on steady nourishment. Iron is your “big domino”: once it rises, energy improves and baby hairs mature faster. You’re in the stabilization phase—keeping your iron consistent now helps move you toward strong regrowth by spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Prioritize one iron-rich meal daily.</strong> Choose options like lentils, beef, tofu, or spinach paired with vitamin C foods (bell pepper, citrus) to boost absorption.</li>\n  <li><strong>Space out coffee or tea.</strong> Wait at least one hour before or after meals—they can block iron uptake when taken together.</li>\n  <li><strong>Add a “booster snack.”</strong> A handful of pumpkin seeds or a small portion of hummus midday helps maintain steady levels.</li>\n  <li><strong>Check on possible shortages.</strong> If you haven’t in a while, ask your doctor for ferritin and full iron panel before spring; that data will show your progress.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More morning energy, fewer dizzy spells when standing, and new hairs around your temples or part line feeling thicker within 2–3 weeks.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals or relying on restrictive dieting can slow iron rebuilding—if appetite is low, try small, iron‑dense bites instead of big plates.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum—each nourishing meal lays a foundation for stronger strands and steadier energy. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>Eat More Good Fats helps you rebuild the deep nutrition that your scalp and hormones rely on. Omega‑3s soothe inflammation, steady mood, and create the healthy oils your follicles bathe in every day.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Aidee, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding still flares under long‑term stress, but baby hairs are proof your scalp is trying to heal. Because chronic stress drains anti‑inflammatory fats, this step is your “big domino.” Replacing those omega‑3s calms stress hormones and keeps new roots anchored as you move toward lasting regrowth this spring.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Add one serving daily:</strong> Eat 100–120 g (about a palm‑size) of fatty fish like salmon, sardines, or trout three times per week, or take an algae or fish oil providing 1000 mg combined EPA + DHA per day.</li>\n<li><strong>Anchor it to breakfast:</strong> Pair with protein — e.g., eggs or Greek yogurt — to create a steady, anti‑stress start of your day.</li>\n<li><strong>Check freshness:</strong> Oil should smell clean, not “fishy.” A bitter or sharp odor means oxidation — replace the bottle.</li>\n<li><strong>Balance fats:</strong> Use olive or avocado oil for cooking; limit fried foods and excess omega‑6 oils (soy, corn, sunflower).</li>\n<li><strong>Stay consistent for four weeks:</strong> The calmer scalp tone and brighter new growth come from steady intake, not megadoses.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Smoother scalp comfort, fewer “itchy” flare‑ups, and a lifted, less anxious mood within 10–14 days.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping meals during busy or stressful days — it blunts absorption. Quick fix: keep single‑serve sardine tins or nuts ready for stress snacks.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one nourishing bite at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: The Popeye Protocol","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Calm the Cycle So Your Follicles Can Catch Their Breath 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Aidee, you’re in the stabilization phase — shedding has slowed, baby hairs are appearing, but your system is still sensitive from years of ongoing chronic stress. This week’s focus is about helping your body feel consistently safe again so it can hold onto those new strands instead of slipping back into a stress-shed loop.</p>\n  <p>Because your main trigger is still active stress and your sleep averages only 5–6 hours, the practices ahead — anchoring your bedtime, winding down fully, and optimizing your sleep space — are the “big domino.” They quiet cortisol surges, reset your nightly hormone rhythm, and give follicles the signal that the emergency is over. Deep, steady sleep is when growth hormones rise and scalp blood flow improves, setting the stage for stronger regrowth in the months leading up to your May stabilization window.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Reset stress hormones:</strong> consistent sleep lowers cortisol that keeps follicles tense</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Balance nightly rhythms:</strong> steadier sleep-wake timing restores hormonal flow to the scalp</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Boost recovery signals:</strong> deep sleep releases growth factors that protect new baby hairs</li>\n    <li>💆‍♀️ <strong>Rebuild resilience:</strong> each calm night trains your body to handle daily tension without shedding spikes</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each evening you protect your wind-down and bedtime, you tell your body it’s safe to grow again — and that’s how this cycle finally shifts in your favor 🌙.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
