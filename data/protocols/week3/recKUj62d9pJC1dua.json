{"week3":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Win Your Day with Breakfast” is a morning grounding ritual built around protein—helping your body feel stable, energized, and hormonally steady before the day even begins.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rosemary, you’re entering your regrowth phase—those new baby hairs are proof your follicles are waking up. But in perimenopause and during chronic stress, morning blood sugar swings can quietly stall that progress. A balanced breakfast rich in protein is your “big domino” right now: it steadies cortisol, supports estrogen balance, and gives your follicles the nutrients to keep thickening through the months ahead.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Plan it tonight:</strong> Decide what’s on your plate before bed—smoothie prep, eggs ready to boil, or tofu scramble ingredients chopped.</li>\n<li><strong>Hit 30 grams of protein:</strong> Aim for at least a palm‑and‑a‑half of protein (about 25–30 g). Try Greek yogurt + chia + berries, or a vegan protein shake with spinach and almond butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Add color and calm:</strong> Include anti‑inflammatory touches—blueberries, avocado, or turmeric.</li>\n<li><strong>Eat within an hour of waking:</strong> This grounds your cortisol rhythm for the day and helps your energy stay steady through mid‑morning.</li>\n<li><strong>Notice the ripple:</strong> Track mood and shedding in your journal; nourishment shows up fast in calmer energy and stronger strands.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy before lunch, fewer sugar cravings, and easier morning focus within a week.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> If you skip breakfast or rely on just coffee, you’ll feel that mid‑morning crash—quick fix: pair your coffee with a protein bite like Greek yogurt or a boiled egg.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds new roots—one mindful breakfast at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice2_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p><em>Tweak What’s on Your Plate</em> helps you quietly upgrade your meals so every bite supports thicker, steadier hair growth. It’s about adding back the nutrients your follicles are craving right now — not tracking, restricting, or forcing anything.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rosemary, you’re in your regrowth phase — shedding has eased, new baby hairs are peeking through, and your follicles need steady fuel to strengthen. With perimenopause and long‑term stress both in play, nourishing from the plate up is your big domino: it stabilizes hormones and keeps those fragile new strands anchored through the coming months of rebuilding.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n<li><strong>Start your day with protein.</strong> Aim for 25–30 g at breakfast — for you that’s two eggs with Greek yogurt and a sprinkle of seeds, or a protein smoothie with nut butter.</li>\n<li><strong>Add omega‑3s.</strong> Since fatty fish is rarely on your menu, introduce a plant source daily — chia pudding, ground flax on oatmeal, or an algae oil supplement with lunch.</li>\n<li><strong>Load every plate with color.</strong> Include at least two vegetables at your main meal; think sautéed spinach beside dinner or roasted peppers in your wrap.</li>\n<li><strong>Include slow carbs, not skipped carbs.</strong> Try quinoa, sweet potato, or oats to steady blood sugar and soothe stress hormones that nudge shedding.</li>\n<li><strong>Hydrate between meals.</strong> Two tall glasses of water mid‑morning and mid‑afternoon help nutrients shuttle smoothly to the follicle roots.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>Early wins:</strong> More stable energy through the day, fewer sugar cravings, and less evening scalp itch within two weeks.</li>\n<li><strong>Watch-outs:</strong> Skipping meals when stressed — it spikes cortisol and stalls regrowth. Keep pre‑made snacks (nuts, boiled eggs, fruit) handy as your quick fix.</li>\n<li>Consistency builds momentum — one balanced plate at a time. 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice3_html":"<section class=\"practice\">\n<h3>What it is</h3>\n<p>“Eat More Good Fats” helps you feed your scalp and hormones with the building blocks they crave — especially omega‑3s like EPA and DHA, found in fatty fish or algae oil. These healthy fats calm inflammation and support steady hormone signals that drive stronger, shinier growth.</p>\n\n<h3>Why this practice matters for you now</h3>\n<p>Rosemary, you’re in the regrowth phase — your shedding has slowed and baby hairs are already pushing through. The next leap forward depends on nourishing those new strands from the inside. Because perimenopause and stress can keep inflammation humming, adding omega‑3s now is your “big domino”: it steadies hormone rhythm, so new hairs mature thicker and stay anchored through mid‑summer stability.</p>\n\n<h3>Step-by-step implementation</h3>\n<ol>\n  <li><strong>Choose your source:</strong> Aim for two servings per week of salmon, sardines, or trout — or take a good‑quality algae or fish‑oil capsule (with combined 1000–1500 mg EPA + DHA daily).</li>\n  <li><strong>Check freshness:</strong> Oil should smell clean, never fishy. Rancid fats can cause the opposite effect — more oxidative stress.</li>\n  <li><strong>Pair with meals:</strong> Take supplements or fish with lunch or dinner that includes protein and vegetables — fats absorb best with food.</li>\n  <li><strong>Balance your ratio:</strong> Limit fried or processed seed oils; swap for olive or avocado oil to keep the omega‑3 to omega‑6 balance in your favor.</li>\n  <li><strong>Stay consistent for one cycle:</strong> Commit for at least eight weeks to feel the difference in scalp comfort and shine.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h3>What to look for</h3>\n<ul>\n  <li><strong>Early wins:</strong> Softer scalp feel, less dryness or flaking, and a subtle glow returning to your skin within 10–14 days.</li>\n  <li><strong>Watch‑outs:</strong> Skipping healthy fats because of past dieting habits can slow progress — fix it by planning one omega‑rich meal at the start of your week.</li>\n  <li>Consistency builds momentum — each nourished meal tells your follicles, “you’re safe to grow.” 🌱</li>\n</ul>\n</section>","practice1_title":"Practice 1: Win Your Day with Breakfast","practice2_title":"Practice 2: Tweak What's on Your Plate","practice3_title":"Practice 3: Eat More Good Fats","week_summary_html":"<div class=\"weekly-summary-content\">\n  <h4>Re‑centering your body so new growth can take hold 🌿</h4>\n  <p>Rosemary, you’re entering the <strong>regrowth‑start phase</strong> — shedding has eased and those fine baby hairs are proof your follicles are waking up. Because your <strong>perimenopause</strong> and <strong>chronic stress</strong> are still active, this week’s focus is to steady your internal rhythms so those new strands can anchor and thicken rather than fall into another shed cycle.</p>\n  <p>Your 6–7 hours of mostly solid sleep gives us a great base. By locking in a consistent bedtime and using the <em>sleep anchor</em> and <em>wind‑down stack</em>, you’ll deepen restorative sleep stages where cortisol drops and growth hormone rises — the very window when follicles rebuild structure. These gentle routines also quiet the stress signals that perimenopause can amplify, helping hormones like estrogen and progesterone communicate more smoothly with your scalp.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Resets cortisol rhythm:</strong> lowers “fight‑or‑flight” noise that stalls regrowth</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Supports hormonal balance:</strong> steadier evening routines help normalize perimenopausal fluctuations</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Activates follicle repair:</strong> deep sleep releases growth factors that strengthen new hairs</li>\n    <li>💫 <strong>Improves stress resilience:</strong> calm evenings buffer emotional strain so recovery can hold</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Each night you protect your sleep window, you’re telling your body it’s safe to grow again — one peaceful evening closer to a stronger, fuller scalp 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
