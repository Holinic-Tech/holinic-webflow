But because your main trigger, rapid weight loss, is still ongoing, your body hasn’t yet felt fully “safe” to shift into steady regrowth. That’s why this week’s focus is to calm your system and give your follicles the green light to stay put.</p>\n  <p>Right now, your sleep is under 5 hours with 2–3 night wakings and late caffeine. That combination keeps cortisol elevated, which tells your body it isn’t time to prioritize hair. By anchoring sleep, building a wind-down stack, and fencing off caffeine, you help regulate stress hormones, restore growth signals released during deep sleep, and create the internal stability your follicles need to hold on to more strands.</p>\n  <ul>\n    <li>🧠 <strong>Lower stress load:</strong> steadier cortisol means fewer “shed now” signals to follicles</li>\n    <li>⚖️ <strong>Hormone rhythm reset:</strong> consistent sleep timing balances cycles tied to hair strength</li>\n    <li>🌱 <strong>Deep repair time:</strong> growth hormone and cell repair switch on in your longest sleep blocks</li>\n    <li>💪 <strong>Trigger buffering:</strong> better resilience even while your dieting stress is still active</li>\n  </ul>\n  <p><em>Every night you protect your sleep window, you’re not just resting — you’re signaling to your body that it’s safe to hold on to your hair and prepare for visible regrowth 🌱.</em></p>\n</div>"}}
