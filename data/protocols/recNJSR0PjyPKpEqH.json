{"week1":{"practice1_html":"<section class=\"practice\"> \n<div class=\"big-domino\"> \n<p>Toby, right now you’re still in the <em>peak phase</em>, with shedding waves driven by your ongoing autoimmune flare and medication shifts. The “big domino” for you is locking in a steady sleep schedule: it’s one thing you can fully control while the medical triggers stabilize. A consistent bedtime calms cortisol curves, steadies thyroid and immune signaling, and can shorten the time it takes your shedding to stabilize—so that regrowth can begin on track in early 2026. 🌙</p> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Pick 1 bedtime and stick within a 30‑min window every night.</li> \n<li>Set a fixed wake time—yes, even weekends.</li> \n<li>Keep your sleep window ~8 hours long.</li> \n<li>Aim for morning light within 30 minutes of waking to anchor your rhythm.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Bedtime target: 11:00 pm–11:30 pm</li> \n<li>Wake target: 7:00 am sharp (alarm consistent daily)</li> \n<li>Full sleep window: ~8 hours</li> \n<li>Morning anchor: step outside or face a window for 5–10 min light exposure</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Tonight, set your alarm for 7:00 am and commit to it the whole week.</li> \n<li>Count backwards 8 hours → lights out aim around 11:00 pm.</li> \n<li>Set a “bedtime prep” reminder 30 min earlier to cut distractions.</li> \n<li>On weekends, resist the temptation to drift later—consistency matters more than total hours averaged.</li> \n<li>If stress/anxious thoughts pop up at night, jot one quick note on paper—then revisit after sleep.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Because your autoimmune flare is ongoing, evening cortisol remains unstable; regular sleep/wake times flatten these spikes and protect follicles from slipping into rest too soon.</li> \n<li>Your shedding waves began in May–Jun and peaked in Jul; consistent sleep timing now may shorten the “tail” of this peak, accelerating stabilization once your flare/med side effects ease.</li> \n<li>Steady circadian rhythm supports thyroid tone and hormone balance, both critical given your irregular cycles and known low‑iron history.</li> \n<li>Morning light + consistent wake time also buffer mood swings and anxiety, lowering daily stress load that otherwise fuels the cycle.</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n\n<div class=\"watch-outs\"> \n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \n<ul> \n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> If you start delaying bedtime by >1 h on weekends, your body clock can reset backward → expect more restless nights and harder stabilization.

High stress and rumination keep cortisol elevated, which locks follicles in shedding mode. A nightly wind down ritual gives your body the signal to shift into repair—helping calm waves of loss in this peak phase so you can move steadily toward stabilization. 🌙</p> \n</div> \n<div class=\"what-to-do\"> \n<h4>What to do</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Create a 30‑minute pre‑bed buffer with no screens or heavy meals</li> \n<li>Choose 1 calming signal: warm shower, light stretching, or gentle breath work</li> \n<li>Keep caffeine cutoff at early afternoon (you’re already close—hold the line)</li> \n<li>Use a simple “transition cue” (dim lights, cup of herbal tea, journaling) to tell your brain the day is closing</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"sleep-schedule\"> \n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Wake: 7:00 am ±15 min (anchor)</li> \n<li>Bed: 11:00 pm target (gives ~8h window)</li> \n<li>Morning light: 5–10 min outside within 30 min of waking</li> \n<li>Evening wind down: begin 10:15 pm</li> \n</ul> \n</div> \n<div class=\"steps\"> \n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \n<ol> \n<li>Set a phone reminder at 10:15 pm → start wind down, dim lights, close laptop.</li> \n<li>Take a warm shower or do 5 minutes of stretching—signals your nervous system to slow.</li> \n<li>Write down ruminations in a notebook → clears them from looping before bed.</li> \n<li>Prepare a small protein‑rich snack earlier in the evening (not right before sleep) so night hunger doesn’t disturb rest.</li> \n<li>Keep wake time steady at 7:00 am, even on weekends—cortisol stabilizer.</li> \n</ol> \n</div> \n<div class=\"why-it-works\"> \n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \n<ul> \n<li>Your ongoing autoimmune flare drives cortisol and inflammation.
