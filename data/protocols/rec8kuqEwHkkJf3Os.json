Right now you’re hovering between peak and stabilization, and the most powerful lever you can pull is a rock-steady sleep rhythm. Consistent timing steadies cortisol, which keeps stress from re‑triggering new waves and signals your body it’s safe to move toward regrowth 🌙.</p> \\n</div> \\n<div class=\\\"what-to-do\\\"> \\n<h4>What to do</h4> \\n<ul> \\n<li>Pick one target bedtime and stick within 30 min every night (yes, weekends).</li> \\n<li>Lock in a fixed wake time anchored by morning light exposure.</li> \\n<li>Keep your 7h sleep about the same length, but make the *timing* non‑negotiable.</li> \\n<li>If anxiety spikes, still keep the schedule—even short sleep at the same hours trains your clock.</li> \\n</ul> \\n</div> \\n<div class=\\\"sleep-schedule\\\"> \\n<h4>Your recommended schedule</h4> \\n<ul> \\n<li>Bedtime: aim for 11:00 pm (±30 min max)</li> \\n<li>Wake time: 6:30 am daily</li> \\n<li>Morning anchor: 5–10 min outside light within 30 min of waking</li> \\n</ul> \\n</div> \\n<div class=\\\"steps\\\"> \\n<h4>Step-by-step implementation</h4> \\n<ol> \\n<li>Choose 11:00 pm as your target “lights out.” Set an alarm 15 min before as a cue.</li> \\n<li>Wake at 6:30 am every day, even if a tough night—it keeps your rhythm locked.</li> \\n<li>Get natural light before screens on waking to reinforce your body clock.</li> \\n<li>Plan meals so last one isn’t crammed at the pillow edge; shift back at least 90 min when you can.</li> \\n<li>On stressful evenings, hold the schedule steady—consistency matters more than perfection.</li> \\n</ol> \\n</div> \\n<div class=\\\"why-it-works\\\"> \\n<h4>Why this works (for you)</h4> \\n<ul> \\n<li>Your ongoing illness and med changes raise cortisol; regular sleep–wake cuts night spikes that push more hairs into telogen.</li> \\n<li>Because your shedding waves lagged illness onset, steady timing shortens the stabilization window so regrowth can start on schedule.</li> \\n<li>High stress + irregular periods suggest hormonal fragility; rhythm stabilizes progesterone and thyroid tone, giving follicles a calmer environment.</li> \\n<li>Paired with adequate protein/iron, solid sleep tells your body energy can be invested in repair—not just survival.</li> \\n</ul> \\n</div> \\n<div class=\\\"watch-outs\\\"> \\n<h4>What to look out for</h4> \\n<ul> \\n<li><strong>Red flags:</strong> Sliding sleep 1–2h later on weekends → undoing your rhythm; if this happens, reset with strict wake times + morning light.</li> \\n<li><strong>Green lights:</strong> Easier wake‑ups within 7–10 days; fewer anxious ruminations before bed; hair fall beginning to flatten rather than surge.</li> \\n<li>Remember: you don’t need “perfect sleep”—just consistent times. Your body will do the rest in the background ❤️.</li> \\n</ul> \\n</div> \\n</section>\",\"title\":\"Consistent Sleep Timing\",\"position\":1}.","practice2_title":null,"practice3_title":null}}
