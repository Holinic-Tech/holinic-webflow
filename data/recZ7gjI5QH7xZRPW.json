Illness and medication usually cause peak fallout about 2–4 months later, while emotional stress hits in a similar window. That’s why your heaviest shedding likely landed between May–Jul 2025.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> We’re past the peak, but because your illness flare is still active, the shedding hasn’t fully stabilized. Right now, your body is in the <em>stabilization phase</em>—not worsening, but not yet in visible regrowth either.</p><p><strong>Looking ahead ⏳:</strong> Once your ongoing flare calms, shedding should settle within 1–2 months. From there, baby hairs typically appear 6–8 weeks later 🌱. Based on timing, this means stabilization could follow soon after the flare eases, with first regrowth signs in late 2025 or early 2026.</p><p>You’re not alone in this. Even though it feels slow, your follicles are resilient and waiting for the green light to regrow. ❤️</p>"}
