The over-exercising episode would have added to this during August. Because your chronic stress is still ongoing, shedding can persist until that load easesâ€”once it does, hair fall usually calms within 1â€“2 months, and baby hairs often follow shortly after. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Chronic stress (ongoing since May 2025) is the main driver because it has not yet resolved, while the illness and over-exercising episodes have already ended.</p>\n<p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You are in the stabilization phaseâ€”shedding has already peaked and is holding steady, but regrowth has not yet started. This can feel discouraging, but itâ€™s actually a sign that the worst is behind you. Once stress lightens, the scalp will be able to shift into recovery and regrowth. ðŸŒ±</p>"}
