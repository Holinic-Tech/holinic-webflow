If that were the only driver, shedding would typically start calming by December 2025â€“March 2026, with early baby hairs appearing from early 2026. However, your ongoing chronic illness flare and emotional stress may extend this timeline, meaning stabilization can take longer until those drivers ease. <span>Dominant driver:</span> The chronic illness flare (ongoing since Apr 2025) is the main driver, as it is continuous and overlaps with your reported worsening.</p>\n<p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You are in the peak shedding phase, which is why the hair fall still feels intense.
