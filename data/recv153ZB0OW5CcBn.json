Once reduced, shedding usually calms within about 1–2 months. Without stress relief, stabilization is delayed.</p><p><strong>Onset window:</strong> Around Dec 2024–Jan 2025 from the hormonal change.</p><p><strong>Regrowth:</strong> You haven’t noticed baby hairs yet, which matches being just past the peak. With stress support, you could expect early regrowth 🌱 by late 2025 (Nov–Dec).</p><p><em>Where you are now:</em> Your shedding has already peaked and is hovering in a stabilization phase, but because stress is active it may feel slower to calm. The hopeful part: once your stress load softens, your hair is primed to recover. ❤️</p>"}
