Hair tends to respond to a fever or major illness about 2–3 months later, so it makes sense that your shedding became noticeable in spring and has continued into summer.</p><p><strong>Main triggers identified:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Major illness with fever</em> (Jan–May 2025) → this fits the classic telogen effluvium pattern, with shedding peaking around Mar–Apr.</li><li><em>Brief over-exercising</em> (early Sept 2025) → short-lived, so less likely to be the main driver.</li></ul><p><strong>Timeline forecast ⏳</strong><br>• Onset: Feb–Mar 2025 from the illness trigger.<br>• Peak shedding: around Apr 2025.<br>• Stabilization: expected by Jul–Oct 2025, once the illness recovery cycle completes.<br>• Regrowth: baby hairs typically appear ~6–8 weeks later – and you’ve already noticed some months ago, which is a great sign 🌱.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> Your answers show shedding still feels worse, but by timing you are likely just past the peak and entering stabilization. Because you’ve spotted early regrowth, your follicles are already reactivating even though shedding hasn’t fully calmed yet.</p><p>❤️ This phase can feel discouraging, but the hardest part is likely behind you. In the coming months you should see shedding gradually settle and those new hairs thicken. I’m not here to diagnose, but I can reassure you: your hair is in recovery mode and moving in the right direction.</p>"}
