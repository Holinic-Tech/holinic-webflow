Because stress is still ongoing, this may slow or extend recovery somewhat. <span>Dominant driver:</span> chronic stress (ongoing since Jun 2025), since it continues beyond surgery and can keep the shedding cycle active.</p>\n<p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You are in the stabilization phase: the initial surge has passed, shedding is no longer escalating, and baby hairs are already visible ðŸŒ±. Thatâ€™s a good sign your follicles are reactivating, even if stress may prolong the process a bit. Step by step, things are moving in the right direction.</p>"}
