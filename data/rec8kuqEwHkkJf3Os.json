The main drivers showing up are an <em>ongoing autoimmune/thyroid flare</em> that started in Feb, a <em>medication change</em> in Mar–May, and a period of <em>acute emotional stress</em> with no exact date given. These overlap and explain why your shedding has come in waves instead of a clear rise-and-fall.</p><p><strong>Triggers in play:</strong></p><ul><li>📌 Autoimmune/thyroid flare (since Feb 2025, still active) — this keeps signaling follicles to pause, so stabilization won’t fully happen until the flare calms.</li><li>📌 Medication change (Mar–May 2025, still ongoing) — often peaks 1–4 months later, matching your mid-summer shedding waves.</li><li>📌 Emotional stress (date not provided) — can amplify shedding but hard to time precisely here.</li></ul><p><strong>Worst month:</strong> Shedding was likely heaviest Jun–Jul 2025, as both the med-change lag and the thyroid flare lined up.</p><p><strong>Onset window:</strong> May 2025 fits with the typical 2–4 month lag after your Feb–Mar triggers.</p><p><strong>Stabilization:</strong> Because the thyroid flare is ongoing, shedding will not fully calm until ~4–8 weeks after the autoimmune activity eases. If the medication is still in use, it can also extend the shedding period.</p><p><strong>Regrowth:</strong> Once the drivers settle, baby hairs usually start showing 6–8 weeks later. That means if the flare improves in late 2025, first fuzz should start appearing by early 2026 🌱.</p><p><em>Where you are now:</em> You’re still in the <strong>peak-to-stabilization transition</strong> — shedding waves are normal with overlapping and ongoing triggers. The key is that when the thyroid/medication piece is steadier, your hair will move into its regrowth rhythm. You’re not stuck here forever ❤️.</p>"}
