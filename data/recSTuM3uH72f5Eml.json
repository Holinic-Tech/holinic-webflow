The picture lines up with several overlapping triggers:</p><ul><li><em>Chronic illness flare</em> that started in Feb 2025 and is still active — this is the dominant driver and keeps your shedding in “waves.”</li><li><em>Medication change</em> from Mar–May 2025, which added an extra push of fallout but has now eased.</li><li><em>Major emotional stress</em>, though no date was given; these usually echo in shedding 2–3 months later.</li></ul><p><strong>Why these matter:</strong> Illness flares, medication shifts, and emotional stress all disturb the follicle growth cycle, pushing more hairs into the resting/shedding phase with a 2–4 month delay. Because your flare hasn’t resolved, the cycle hasn’t yet fully calmed.</p><p><strong>Timeline forecast ⏳</strong><br/>• Worst shedding months: May–Jun 2025.<br/>• Medication fallout: should have settled by Sep 2025.<br/>• Stabilization: will only begin 4–8 weeks after the illness flare eases.<br/>• Regrowth 🌱: usually shows 6–8 weeks after stabilization, with little baby hairs coming in at the hairline.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re in the <em>stabilization phase</em> — the medication effect is fading, but the ongoing illness flare is stretching out the shedding. The lack of baby hairs is expected for now; once your system steadies, regrowth will follow quickly.</p><p>❤️ Remember: your hair is resilient. As your body finds balance, your follicles will shift back into growth mode.</p>"}
