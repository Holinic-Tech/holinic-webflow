The key triggers showing up are:</p><ul><li><em>Chronic illness flare</em> since Feb 2025 and still ongoing — this keeps hair in a stress cycle until the condition settles.</li><li><em>Medication change</em> started Mar 2025 and continued through May; some hair fall from this may still be echoing in your cycle.</li><li><em>Major emotional stress</em> also noted, though no dates provided — emotional shocks typically show up 2–3 months later in shedding.</li></ul><p><strong>Why these matter:</strong> Both chronic illness flares and medication changes disturb the normal growth phase, pushing extra hairs into shedding after a lag of ~2–4 months. Because your illness flare remains active, the shedding \"waves\" you describe make sense.</p><p><strong>Timeline forecast ⏳</strong>:<br/>• Most intense shedding likely peaked between May–July 2025.<br/>• Stabilization from the medication change alone would be expected around Sep–Nov 2025, but the ongoing illness flare delays full calming. Stabilization will begin ~4–8 weeks once that flare is under control.<br/>• Regrowth signs (baby hairs around the hairline) typically show 6–8 weeks after stabilization begins 🌱.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re in the <em>stabilization phase</em>, with the medication-related fallout winding down but the illness flare still prolonging activity. No baby hairs yet is expected at this stage — once the flare eases, regrowth will follow.</p><p>❤️ You’re not alone in this — once the ongoing trigger resolves, your body has a strong track record of bouncing back. I’m not here to diagnose, just to map the story your hair is telling right now.</p>"}
