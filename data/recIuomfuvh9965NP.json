Because perimenopause and stress remain active, progress may be slower but still steady as those stabilize. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Perimenopause and persistent stress are the main ongoing influences, while the Mar 2025 medication change best matches the timing of your initial shedding surge.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the stabilization phase—shedding is easing, though new regrowth may still be subtle. This is a positive turning point: keep supporting sleep, stress balance, and nutrition so those fresh hairs can emerge soon. 🌱</p>"}
