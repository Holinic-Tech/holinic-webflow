Because chronic stress has continued, recovery has been slower. Based on her report of baby hairs appearing months ago, the worst shedding likely occurred around lateâ€¯2024, with stabilization expected around midâ€‘2025 and stronger regrowth following soon after. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Chronic stress is the main driver, as itâ€™s still active and prolongs the recovery that began after earlier acute triggers.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> Rochelle is in the <em>stabilization</em> phaseâ€”new shedding should gradually decrease as ongoing stress is managed, and baby hairs will keep thickening. ðŸŒ± Each small improvement in stress balance can help her scalp regain its rhythm.</p>"}
