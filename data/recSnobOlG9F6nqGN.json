But you also have two ongoing drivers — chronic illness flare and continuing weight loss — which explains why shedding still feels unpredictable and \"wave-like.\"</p><p><strong>Onset:</strong> You first noticed shedding in Jul 2025, exactly in line with the 2–4 month lag we expect after January shocks.</p><p><strong>Worst period:</strong> Peak shedding likely landed around Mar–Apr 2025, then stretched through summer because of the unresolved drivers.</p><p><strong>Stabilization:</strong> For now, stabilization depends on when the active triggers settle. Once weight loss slows and the chronic illness flare calms, shedding should ease within 4–8 weeks ⏳.</p><ul><li><em>Ongoing drivers:</em> chronic illness flare, weight loss</li><li><em>Past triggers:</em> surgery, illness, emotional stress, hormone change, postpartum, injury, medication change</li></ul><p><strong>Regrowth:</strong> You’ll usually see baby hairs ~6–8 weeks after stabilization 🌱.
