Early baby hairs generally appear 1–2 months after shedding calms, so visible regrowth may start around early 2026 if iron stores remain stable. <span>Dominant driver:</span> low iron deficiency, as it matches the 6–12‑month lag and explains the continued plateau until nutrients are fully restored.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You appear to be in the <em>stabilization</em> phase — shedding has stopped worsening but density recovery takes time.
