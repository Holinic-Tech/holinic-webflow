The current pattern is best explained by the combined effect of perimenopause and chronic stress, both ongoing since early 2026. Based on similar hormonal‑stress patterns, shedding would typically peak around Mar–Apr 2026, calm by mid‑summer, and show fuller regrowth by late 2026. These dates may shift if stress levels remain high. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Ongoing perimenopause, as it temporally aligns with her recent shedding and continues to influence the hair cycle.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the regrowth_start phase — shedding has eased and baby hairs are emerging.
