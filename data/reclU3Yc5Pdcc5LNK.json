That lines up closely with two main triggers: a high-fever illness in June, and the buildup of chronic stress that started back in April. Over‑exercising earlier in the year may have added strain but has since ended.</p><p><strong>Triggers identified:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Major illness with fever</em> (Jun 2025) – shedding usually peaks 2–3 months later, so Aug–Sep would be the toughest stretch.</li><li><em>Chronic stress</em> (since Apr 2025, still ongoing) – this keeps pressure on the system until it eases.</li><li><em>Over‑exercising</em> (Jan–Sep 2025) – likely amplified the shedding, but now that you’ve stopped, your body can recover.</li></ul><p><strong>Worst month:</strong> Your answers suggest August 2025 was the heaviest shedding period. Now, with shedding described as “peaked then stable” and baby hairs already appearing months ago, you’re moving into a calmer stretch.</p><p><strong>Stabilization:</strong> Hair fall usually steadies about 3–6 months after the fever illness — pointing to Nov–Dec 2025 — though ongoing stress could delay this until you find better balance.</p><p><strong>Regrowth:</strong> Since you’ve already spotted baby hairs, the regrowth phase has begun 🌱. Over the next few months they’ll thicken, especially if stress levels ease and your protein/omega intake improves.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re between late stabilization and early regrowth — the hardest part is behind you. From here, shedding should gradually lessen, and more new sprouts will become visible.</p><p>❤️ You’re not alone in this. Your body has already started turning the corner — keep supporting it, and you’ll see your hair strengthen step by step.</p>"}
