With multiple ongoing metabolic and hormonal stresses, stabilization likely extends through late 2024, with visible regrowth improving through early 2025. <span>Dominant driver:</span> the combination of chronic stress, restrictive dieting, and perimenopauseâ€”all ongoingâ€”continues to influence shedding, while the illness episode set the initial wave that matched the onset timing. These ongoing factors may delay full stabilization slightly.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You appear to be in the <em>stabilization</em> phaseâ€”shedding is less extreme, and regrowth is underway but still balancing against ongoing stress and hormonal shifts. Keep nurturing your recovery habits; steady routines and nutrition will help new growth strengthen month by month. ðŸŒ±</p>"}
