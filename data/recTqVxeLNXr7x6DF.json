The main drivers are:</p><ul><li><em>Chronic illness flare</em> that began in Feb 2025 and is still ongoing — this keeps hair in a heightened stress cycle until the flare is managed.</li><li><em>Medication change</em> from Mar–May 2025 — these shifts often trigger shedding 1–3 months later. Some of that effect has likely already tapered.</li><li><em>Major emotional stress</em> (date not provided) — typically shows up 2–3 months later in shedding and may have added to the “waves” you noticed.</li></ul><p><strong>Why these matter:</strong> Illness flares and medication changes both disturb the growth phase, pushing more hairs to shed after a few months. Because your flare is still active, the body hasn’t fully calmed, which explains why the shedding feels cyclical.</p><p><strong>Timeline forecast ⏳</strong>:<br/>• Peak shedding likely landed May–Jul 2025.<br/>• Medication-related fallout should settle by Sep–Nov 2025.<br/>• The ongoing illness flare means stabilization won’t be complete until ~4–8 weeks after that flare is under control.<br/>• Visible regrowth (baby hairs) usually follows 6–8 weeks after stabilization 🌱.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re sitting in the <em>stabilization phase</em>: the medication effect is winding down, but the chronic illness trigger is still keeping the cycle a bit unsettled. It makes sense you haven’t spotted new baby hairs yet.</p><p>❤️ You’re not alone. Once the flare eases, your body has a strong track record of growing new hair back — and that phase is ahead of you.</p>"}
