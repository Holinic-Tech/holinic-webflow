Because chronic stress remains active, it can sustain a low-level shedding pattern. The worst shedding month linked to that illness was likely 2020-11, with stabilization by 2021-05 and potential regrowth from 2021-07 if stress had resolved. Since stress is ongoing, stabilization may be delayed until stress levels ease. <span>Dominant driver:</span> Chronic stress is the main driver, as it has persisted and continues to influence hair cycling even after the illness resolved.</p><p><strong>Where you are now.</strong> You’re in the stabilization phase — shedding is no longer worsening but regrowth may be slow while stress remains high. Once stress levels improve, new hairs should begin to appear steadily. 🌱</p>"}
