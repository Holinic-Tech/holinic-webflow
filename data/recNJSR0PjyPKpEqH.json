These stack together and explain why shedding feels prolonged and comes in waves.</p><p><strong>Why they matter:</strong></p><ul><li><em>Autoimmune/thyroid flare (since Feb 2025, ongoing):</em> Inflammation and hormone shifts disrupt the growth cycle, and shedding persists until the flare calms.</li><li><em>Medication change (from Mar 2025, still active):</em> Certain drugs can trigger shedding 2–4 months later, keeping pressure on the cycle.</li><li><em>Emotional stress (date not given):</em> Acute stress typically causes shedding 2–3 months later, though this tends to settle once emotions ease.</li></ul><p><strong>Timeline so far:</strong> You first noticed shedding around May–Jun 2025. Shedding likely peaked in Jun–Jul 2025. Because the illness flare and medication change remain unresolved, stabilization hasn’t started yet. The “waves” you describe fit overlapping triggers.</p><p><strong>What’s next:</strong> Once the flare and medication side effects settle, shedding should calm within 3–6 months. Baby hairs usually appear ~6–8 weeks after stabilization 🌱. If drivers ease this autumn, visible regrowth is realistic by early 2026.</p><p><strong>Where you are now:</strong> You’re still in the <em>peak phase</em>, meaning shedding is active but not permanent loss. The moment those triggers reduce, your hair will shift back toward growth. ❤️</p><p><em>I’m not here to diagnose, but I can show you the story your hair is telling: it’s still responding to ongoing stressors, not closing the door on recovery.</em></p>"}
