Please provide the following values (they're already in your GitHub secrets):

1. WEBFLOW_TOKEN - Your Webflow API token
2. OPENAI_API_KEY - Your OpenAI API key

You can find these in your GitHub repository settings under:
Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions

Once you provide these, I'll set them as Cloudflare secrets and deploy the worker.
