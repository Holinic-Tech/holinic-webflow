# Final Test Instructions

## System Status ✅
- Pattern matching: Fixed (exact match only)
- Page naming: Fixed (de-the-haircare-challenge format)
- Worker deployed and working
- OpenAI JSON parsing: Fixed (handles markdown-wrapped responses)

## What You Need
1. **Webflow Token**: ✅ Already have it
2. **OpenAI API Key**: ✅ Have valid key but getting region error

## Known Issue: OpenAI Region Restriction
The OpenAI API is returning "unsupported_country_region_territory" error because Cloudflare Workers can run from data centers in regions where OpenAI doesn't provide service.

### Solutions:
1. **Use GitHub Actions instead** (runs from US regions)
2. **Set up a proxy endpoint** in a supported region
3. **Use an alternative translation API** (Google Translate, DeepL, etc.)

## Test Locally
```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-actual-openai-key-here"
./test-single-page.sh
```

## Run via GitHub Actions
1. Update the GitHub secret `OPENAI_API_KEY` with a valid key
2. Go to: https://github.com/Holinic-Tech/holinic-webflow/actions
3. Run "Webflow Translation" with:
   - URL patterns: `the-haircare-challenge` (exactly this, no wildcards)
   - Target language: `de`
   - Action: `translate`

## What Will Happen
1. Worker will find exactly 1 page: "the-haircare-challenge"
2. It will translate the content to German
3. Create a new page: "de-the-haircare-challenge"
4. You'll see it in your Webflow dashboard

## Pattern Matching Examples
- `the-haircare-challenge` → Matches ONLY "the-haircare-challenge"
- `*haircare-challenge` → Matches all pages ending with "haircare-challenge"
- `the-haircare-challenge*` → Matches all pages starting with "the-haircare-challenge"
- `*the-haircare-challenge*` → Matches all pages containing "the-haircare-challenge"

## Folder Structure (Future)
Once we have the folder IDs, we can update the worker to create pages inside language folders instead of using prefixes.
