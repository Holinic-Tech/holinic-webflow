# French Locale Setup Summary

## Current Status

✅ **French locale is configured in Webflow**
- Locale ID: `684683d87f6a3ae6079ec99f`
- CMS Locale ID: `684683d87f6a3ae6079ec9a2`
- Subdirectory: `/fr/`
- Tag: `fr`
- Status: Enabled

## Key Findings

1. **French locale exists but has no content**
   - The locale is properly configured in Webflow
   - The DOM API accepts the French locale ID
   - However, there are 0 DOM nodes for French pages (compared to 520 for English)
   - This indicates the French version needs to be created in Webflow Designer first

2. **Configuration Updates Made**
   - Updated `translation-server.js` with French locale ID
   - Updated `translate-any-page.js` with French locale ID
   - Updated `src/translation-worker.js` with French locale ID
   - Created documentation in `LOCALE_IDS.md`

## Next Steps

### Option 1: Create French Page in Webflow Designer (Recommended)
1. Open the Webflow Designer
2. Select the page you want to translate (e.g., "the-haircare-challenge")
3. Switch to French locale in the designer
4. The page structure will be created for French
5. Save and publish
6. Then use the translation scripts to populate content

### Option 2: Use Translation Scripts (After Designer Setup)
Once the French page structure exists in Webflow:

```bash
# Translate the haircare challenge page to French
node translate-any-page.js --slug="the-haircare-challenge" --lang="fr"

# Or use the complete translation script
node translate-complete-page.js --pageId="672c82dd7bb594490ba42d38" --targetLang="fr"
```

## Important Notes

- Unlike German (which already had 330 DOM nodes), French starts with 0 nodes
- This suggests the German translation was already set up in Webflow Designer
- The translation scripts can only work with existing page structures
- You need to create the French page variant in Webflow Designer first

## French Translation Instructions

The system is configured with these French translation rules:
- Use informal "tu" throughout
- Keep "Challenge" untranslated
- Natural conversational French
- Convert all USD ($, US$) to EUR (€)
