# French Translation API Fix - January 9, 2025

## Issue Summary
French translations were not appearing on the live Webflow site even though the API calls seemed successful and logs showed nodes being processed.

## Root Cause
The Webflow DOM API v2 requires a specific format for updating locale content:

### ❌ Incorrect Format (What we were using)
```javascript
{
  nodes: [
    {
      id: nodeId,  // Wrong - should be "nodeId"
      text: {
        text: translatedText,
        html: translatedHtml
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

### ✅ Correct Format (What Webflow expects)
```javascript
{
  nodes: [
    {
      nodeId: nodeId,  // Must use "nodeId" not "id"
      text: htmlContent  // Must be a string with HTML tags included, not an object
    }
  ]
}
```

## Key Learnings

1. **API Field Names Matter**: The field must be `nodeId` not `id`
2. **HTML Structure Required**: The `text` field must include HTML tags (e.g., `<p>Translated text</p>`), not just plain text
3. **Error Messages Were Misleading**: The API returned "Root element not provided: Expected [tag]" which didn't clearly indicate the format issue

## Fix Applied

In `translate-french-progressive.js`, we updated the node preparation code:

```javascript
// OLD CODE
return {
  id: node.id,
  text: {
    text: translatedText,
    html: htmlWithTranslation
  }
};

// NEW CODE
return {
  nodeId: node.id,
  text: finalText  // finalText includes HTML tags
};
```

## Prevention

1. Always check the exact API format requirements in Webflow documentation
2. Test with a single node first to verify the format works
3. Pay attention to seemingly successful API calls that don't produce visible results
4. The German translation script (`translate-all-english-progressive.js`) was already using the correct format - use it as a reference
