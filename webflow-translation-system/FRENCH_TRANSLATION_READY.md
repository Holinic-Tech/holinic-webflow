# French Translation System - Ready! ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

## Configuration Complete

I've successfully added French locale support to your translation system with the following specifications:

### French Translation Guidelines

The system is configured to translate with these principles:
- **Tone**: Informal "tu" throughout - like talking to a girlfriend
- **Target Audience**: Women aged 25-35 
- **Style**: Friendly, conversational French that sounds natural and relatable
- **Voice**: Like chatting with your best friend - warm, encouraging, using expressions young French women actually say

### Key Translation Rules

```
- "14-Day Haircare Challenge" â†’ "Challenge capillaire de 14 jours"
- "Good hair days" â†’ "Des cheveux parfaits tous les jours"
- "Challenge" (standalone) â†’ keep as "Challenge"
- "Hairqare" â†’ NEVER translate (brand name)
- "DIY" â†’ keep as "DIY"
- "Hassle" â†’ "GalÃ¨re" or "Prise de tÃªte" (NOT "Tracas")
- Currency: USD ($) â†’ EUR (â‚¬)
```

### Technical Details

- **French Locale ID**: `684683d87f6a3ae6079ec99f`
- **Subdirectory**: `/fr/`
- **Status**: Locale exists but pages need content created in Webflow Designer

## How to Trigger French Translation

### Option 1: New Multilingual Script (Recommended)
```bash
cd webflow-translation-system
node translate-page-multilingual.js --lang fr --page the-haircare-challenge
```

### Option 2: Via Browser Interface
1. Open `translate-via-cli.html` in your browser
2. Select "French (fr)" from the language dropdown
3. Enter your page slug
4. Copy and run the generated commands

### Option 3: Direct API
The translation-dashboard.html and all API endpoints now support French.

## Important Note

The French locale currently has 0 nodes, which means you need to:
1. Open the page in Webflow Designer
2. Switch to the French locale (top toolbar)
3. Save the page to create the content structure
4. Then run the translation script

## What I've Updated

1. âœ… Created `translate-page-multilingual.js` - supports both German and French
2. âœ… Updated `translate-via-cli.html` to include French option
3. âœ… Added French language detection (prevents re-translating)
4. âœ… Configured French-specific translation instructions
5. âœ… Created test scripts to verify setup

## Quick Test

To verify everything is working:
```bash
node test-french-translation.js
```

You're all set to start translating to French! ðŸŽ‰
