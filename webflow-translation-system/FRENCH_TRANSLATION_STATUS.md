# French Translation Status ðŸ‡«ðŸ‡·

## Current Status
The French translation system is **fully configured and working**. The translation process is currently running.

## What's Happening
1. **Translation Script**: `translate-french-progressive.js` is processing 203 text nodes
2. **Progress**: Saving progress to `french-translation-progress.json` (can resume if interrupted)
3. **Method**: Using the correct Webflow API v2 POST to `/dom` with locale ID

## How to Complete Translation

### Option 1: Continue Current Process
The script is already running. It will:
- Process all 203 text nodes in batches of 20
- Save progress after each batch
- Automatically publish when complete

If it times out, simply run again:
```bash
node translate-french-progressive.js
```

### Option 2: Use the Complete Page Script
After updating it with French support:
```bash
node translate-complete-page.js the-haircare-challenge fr
```

### Option 3: Use the Multilingual Script
```bash
node translate-page-multilingual.js --lang fr --page challenge
```

## Verify Translation
Once complete, verify at:
```bash
# Check API
node verify-french-translation.js

# Check live site
open https://hairqare.co/fr/challenge
```

## Key French Translations Applied
- "14-Day Haircare Challenge" â†’ "Challenge capillaire de 14 jours"
- "Good hair days" â†’ "Des cheveux parfaits tous les jours"
- USD ($) â†’ EUR (â‚¬)
- Informal "tu" throughout
- Friendly, conversational tone for women 25-35

## Notes
- The translation uses the same API approach as the working German translation
- Progress is saved, so interruptions are not a problem
- The site will be automatically published when translation completes

## If You Need to Start Fresh
```bash
rm -f french-translation-progress.json
node translate-french-progressive.js
```
