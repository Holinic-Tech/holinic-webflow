# Debug Instructions - Webflow Translation System

## The Issue
The translation is failing with the error: `node.text.trim is not a function`

This means that Webflow's DOM API is returning `node.text` values that aren't strings.

## How to Debug

### Option 1: Use the Debug HTML Page (Easiest)

1. Open the debug page in your browser:
   ```bash
   open debug-test.html
   ```

2. Enter your credentials:
   - **Webflow API Token**: Your token from Webflow settings
   - **Page Slug**: Leave as `the-haircare-challenge`
   - **OpenAI API Key**: Only needed for translation test

3. Click **"üß™ Run Debug Test"**

4. Check the browser console (F12 ‚Üí Console tab) to see the raw response

5. The page will show:
   - What type `node.text` actually is
   - How many non-string text nodes exist
   - Sample data causing the error

### Option 2: Run Direct API Test

1. Set your Webflow token:
   ```bash
   export WEBFLOW_TOKEN="your-webflow-token-here"
   ```

2. Run the test script:
   ```bash
   node test-webflow-api.js
   ```

3. Check the output and the generated `webflow-dom-response.json` file

### Option 3: Use curl to Test Debug Worker

```bash
# Replace YOUR_TOKEN with your actual Webflow token
curl -s "https://webflow-translation-debug.dndgroup.workers.dev/debug/the-haircare-challenge?token=YOUR_TOKEN&siteId=62cbaa353a301eb715aa33d0" | jq '.'
```

## What We're Looking For

1. **Non-string text values**: The error suggests `node.text` exists but isn't a string
2. **Array or object text**: Maybe Webflow returns arrays or objects for rich text
3. **Null/undefined handling**: Perhaps some nodes have `node.text = null`

## Once We Find the Issue

Based on what type `node.text` actually is, we can:
- Handle arrays of text (join them?)
- Handle objects (extract a specific property?)
- Skip non-string text nodes
- Convert non-strings to strings appropriately

## Current Status

‚úÖ Fixed in code but error persists
‚úÖ Debug tools deployed
‚ùå Need to understand actual Webflow response
‚ùå Need to handle the specific data type causing the error
