# Quick Server Check

## The Issue
When you click "Start Translation", the page refreshes instead of showing progress. This happens when:
1. The backend server isn't running
2. You're opening the HTML file directly instead of through the server

## Solution

### Step 1: Start the server
```bash
cd /Users/tobydietz/Documents/GitHub/holinic-webflow/webflow-translation-system
./start-dashboard.sh
```

Or:
```bash
npm run dashboard
```

### Step 2: Access through the server
Open your browser to:
```
http://localhost:3000
```

NOT: `file:///path/to/translation-dashboard.html`

## What You Should See

When working correctly:
1. Click "Start Translation"
2. NO page refresh
3. Progress bar appears and starts moving
4. Live logs show in the black terminal window
5. Real-time updates like:
   - "Finding page..."
   - "Fetching nodes 1-100..."
   - "Translating nodes..."
   - Progress percentage
6. When complete, shows success message with link to translated page

## If Still Not Working

Check that your .env file has all required variables:
```
WEBFLOW_TOKEN=your_token_here
OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
WEBFLOW_SITE_ID=your_site_id_here
```
