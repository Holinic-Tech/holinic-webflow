# Translation Progress Estimate

## Current Status (14 minutes in)

### What's Happening
The worker is processing 14 pages sequentially with these steps for each page:

1. **Fetch page content** from Webflow (~1-2 seconds)
2. **Extract translatable content** (~instant)
3. **Call OpenAI API** for translation (~5-30 seconds depending on content size)
4. **Create new page** in Webflow (~2-3 seconds)
5. **Update page content** with translations (~2-3 seconds)
6. **Wait 1 second** before next page (rate limit protection)

### Time Estimate per Page
- Minimum: ~11 seconds (1+5+2+2+1)
- Average: ~20 seconds (2+15+2.5+2.5+1)
- Maximum: ~39 seconds (2+30+3+3+1)

### Total Time Estimate for 14 Pages
- Minimum: ~2.5 minutes
- Average: ~4.5 minutes
- Maximum: ~9 minutes

However, if the OpenAI API is slow or if pages have lots of content, it could take longer.

### Current Progress
After 14 minutes, the worker has likely:
- Processed: 8-12 pages (assuming ~1-1.5 minutes per page with delays)
- Remaining: 2-6 pages

### Check GitHub Actions Logs
The GitHub Actions logs should show progress. Look for lines like:
- "Processing 1/14: the-haircare-challenge"
- "Processing 2/14: 1-the-haircare-challenge"
- etc.

### What If It's Stuck?
If it's been more than 20 minutes:
1. The OpenAI API might be very slow
2. There might be an error that's not being reported
3. The worker might have timed out (30-second limit per request)

### Monitor Progress
You can check:
1. **GitHub Actions logs** - Should show real-time progress
2. **Webflow dashboard** - New pages should appear as they're created
3. **Worker logs** - Using `wrangler tail` (though it's not showing output currently)
